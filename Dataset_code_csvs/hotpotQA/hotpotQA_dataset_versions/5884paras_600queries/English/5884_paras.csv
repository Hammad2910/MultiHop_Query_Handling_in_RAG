60,1976 NBA draft,"The 1976 NBA draft was the 30th annual draft of the National Basketball Association (NBA).  The draft was held on June 8, 1976, before the 1976–77 season.

The Atlanta Hawks won the coin flip and were awarded the first overall pick, while the Chicago Bulls were awarded the second pick.  The Hawks then traded the first pick to the Houston Rockets before the draft.  The remaining first-round picks and the subsequent rounds were assigned to teams in reverse order of their win–loss record in the previous season.  The New York Knicks forfeited their first-round draft pick due to their illegal signing of George McGinnis whose rights were held by the Philadelphia 76ers.

A player who had finished his four-year college eligibility was eligible for selection.  If a player left college early, he would not be eligible for selection until his college class graduated.  Before the draft, 26 college underclassmen were declared eligible for selection under the ""hardship"" rule.  13 of them withdrew before the draft, leaving only 13 early entry candidates eligible for selection.  These players had applied and gave evidence of financial hardship to the league, which granted them the right to start earning their living by starting their professional careers earlier.  The draft consisted of 10 rounds comprising the selection of 173 players.  On August 8, 1976, the league also hosted a Dispersal draft for ABA players from the Kentucky Colonels and Spirits of St. Louis, who were not included in the ABA–NBA merger."

120,Tropical cyclone forecast model,"A tropical cyclone forecast model is a computer program that uses meteorological data to forecast aspects of the future state of tropical cyclones.  There are three types of models: statistical, dynamical, or combined statistical-dynamic.  Dynamical models utilize powerful supercomputers with sophisticated mathematical modeling software and meteorological data to calculate future weather conditions.  Statistical models forecast the evolution of a tropical cyclone in a simpler manner, by extrapolating from historical datasets, and thus can be run quickly on platforms such as personal computers. Statistical-dynamical models use aspects of both types of forecasting.  Four primary types of forecasts exist for tropical cyclones: track, intensity, storm surge, and rainfall.  Dynamical models were not developed until the 1970s and the 1980s, with earlier efforts focused on the storm surge problem."
121,Computer lab,"A computer lab is a space which provides computer services to a defined community.  Computer labs are typically provided by libraries to the public, by academic institutions to students who attend the institution, or by other institutions to the public or to people affiliated with that institution.  Users typically must follow a certain user policy to retain access to the computers.  This generally consists of the user not engaging in illegal activities or attempting to circumvent any security or content-control software while using the computers.  In public settings, computer lab users are often subject to time limits, in order to allow more people a chance to use the lab, whereas in other institutions, computer access typically requires valid personal login credentials, which may also allow the institution to track the user's activities.  Computers in computer labs are typically equipped with internet access, while scanners and printers may augment the lab setup.  Computers in computer labs are typically arranged either in rows, so that every workstation has a similar view of one end of the room to facilitate lecturing or presentations, or in clusters, to facilitate small group work.  In some cases, generally in academic institutions, student laptops or laptop carts take the place of dedicated computer labs, although computer labs still have a place in applications requiring special software or hardware not practically implementable in personal computers."

123,History of personal computers,"The history of the personal computer as a mass-market consumer electronic device began with the microcomputer revolution of the 1980s.  The 1981 launch of the IBM Personal Computer coined both the term ""Personal Computer"" and ""PC"".  A personal computer is one intended for interactive individual use, as opposed to a mainframe computer where the end user's requests are filtered through operating staff, or a time-sharing system in which one large processor is shared by many individuals.  After the development of the microprocessor, individual personal computers were low enough in cost that they eventually became affordable consumer goods.  Early personal computers – generally called microcomputers – were sold often in electronic kit form and in limited numbers, and were of interest mostly to hobbyists and technicians."
124,Comx-35,"The COMX-35 was a home computer that was one of the very few systems to use the RCA 1802 microprocessor, the same microprocessor that is also used in some space probes."
125,Digital Retro,"Digital Retro (full title Digital Retro: The Evolution and Design of the Personal Computer) is a coffee table book about the history of home computers and personal computers.

Its contents cover home computers, along with some business models and video game consoles, but hardware such as minicomputers and mainframes is excluded."
126,Zenith Data Systems,"Zenith Data Systems (ZDS) was a division of Zenith Electronics founded in 1979 after Zenith acquired Heathkit, which had, in 1977, entered the personal computer market.  Headquartered in Benton Harbor, Michigan, Zenith sold personal computers under both the Heath/Zenith and Zenith Data Systems names.  Zenith was an early partner with Microsoft, licensing all Microsoft languages for the Heath/Zenith 8-bit computers.  Conversely, Microsoft programmers of the early 1980s did much of their work using Zenith Z-19 and Z-29 CRT display terminals hooked to central mainframe computers.  The first Heathkit H8 computer, sold in kit form, was built on an Intel 8080 processor.  It ran K7 audio-tape software, punched tape software (with puncher/reader H10) and HDOS (Heath Disk Operating System) software on 5¼"" hard-sectored floppy disks.  The CP/M operating system was adapted to all Heath/Zenith computers, in 1979.  Next, the early Heath/Zenith computers (H88/H89 and Z-89) were based on the Z80 processors and ran either HDOS or CP/M operating systems."
127,Sharp MZ,The Sharp MZ is a series of personal computers sold in Japan and Europe (particularly Germany and Great Britain) by Sharp beginning in 1978.
128,Early mainframe games,"Mainframe computers are computers used primarily by businesses and academic institutions for large-scale processes.  Before personal computers, first termed microcomputers, became widely available to the general public in the 1970s, the computing industry was composed of mainframe computers and the relatively smaller and cheaper minicomputer variant.  During the mid to late 1960s, many early video games were programmed on these computers.  Developed prior to the rise of the commercial video game industry in the early 1970s, these early mainframe games were generally written by students or employees at large corporations in a machine or assembly language that could only be understood by the specific machine or computer type they were developed on.  While many of these games were lost as older computers were discontinued, some of them were ported to high-level computer languages like BASIC, had expanded versions later released for personal computers, or were recreated for bulletin board systems years later, thus influencing future games and developers."
129,Digital electronic computer,"In computer science, a digital electronic computer is a computer machine which is both an electronic computer and a digital computer.  Examples of a digital electronic computers include the IBM PC, the Apple Macintosh as well as modern smartphones.  When computers that were both digital and electronic appeared, they displaced almost all other kinds of computers, but computation has historically been performed in various non-digital and non-electronic ways: the Lehmer sieve is an example of a digital non-electronic computer, while analog computers are examples of non-digital computers which can be electronic (with analog electronics), and mechanical computers are examples of non-electronic computers (which may be digital or not).  An example of a computer which is both non-digital and non-electronic is the ancient Antikythera mechanism found in Greece.  All kinds of computers, whether they are digital or analog, and electronic or non-electronic, can be Turing complete if they have sufficient memory.  A digital electronic computer is not necessarily a programmable computer, a stored program computer, or a general purpose computer, since in essence a digital electronic computer can be built for one specific application and be non-reprogrammable.  As of 2014, most personal computers and smartphones in people's homes that use multicore central processing units (such as AMD FX, Intel Core i7, or the multicore varieties of ARM-based chips) are also parallel computers using the MIMD (multiple instructions - multiple data) paradigm, a technology previously only used in digital electronic supercomputers.  As of 2014, most digital electronic supercomputers are also cluster computers, a technology that can be used at home in the form of small Beowulf clusters. Parallel computation is also possible with non-digital or non-electronic computers.  An example of a parallel computation system using the abacus would be a group of human computers using a number of abacus machines for computation and communicating using natural language."

In New Hollywood films, the film director, rather than the studio, took on a key authorial role.  The definition of New Hollywood varies, depending on the author, with some of them defining it as a movement and others as a period.  The span of the period is also a subject of debate, as well as its integrity, as some authors, such as Thomas Schatz, argue that the New Hollywood consist of several different movements.  The films made in this movement are stylistically characterized in that their narrative often strongly deviated from classical norms."

170,Fir,"Firs (Abies) are a genus of 48–56 species of evergreen coniferous trees in the family Pinaceae.  They are found through much of North and Central America, Europe, Asia, and North Africa, occurring in mountains over most of the range.  Firs are most closely related to the genus ""Cedrus"" (cedar).  Douglas firs are not true firs, being of the genus ""Pseudotsuga""."
171,Stapeliae,"The genera of plants within the tribe Stapeliae are all to varying degrees stem succulents.  Many of the species resemble cacti, though are not closely related, as an example of convergent evolution.  The stems are often angular, mostly four-angled in cross-section, but in some species there are six or more, with some species of ""Hoodia"" having more than thirty angles.  In size they vary from less than 2.5 cm/1"" in length to over 2 m/6"" tall.  The leaves are in most species reduced to rudiments, sometimes hardened and thorn-like, arranged on bumps or tubercles on the angles.  Some species, however, still have recognisable leaves, most notably the Indian species ""Frerea indica"", and some members of ""Tridentea"".  Stapeliads are most abundant in warm, dry climates.  In Africa, there are two separate regions where Stapeliads have most diversified: northeast Africa, and Southern Africa.  Several species are endemic to the small island of Socotra off the Horn of Africa.  The Arabian Peninsula, and most specifically the country of Yemen, contain another concentration of species.  Several more are found in the drier parts of Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Nepal, and Myanmar.  A single species, ""Caralluma europea"" is found in Europe, in the very southern part of the Iberian peninsula.  Stapeliads are often regarded as a climax group within the family because of their often structurally complex flowers. Certain aspects of these reproductive parts mirror the pollination systems in the Orchid family and represent a case of parallel evolution though both groups are quite unrelated and have developed similar, though not identical means to achieve the ultimate goal of pollination and therefore reproduction.  Most stapeliads use flies as pollinators, that are attracted to odours resembling dung or rotting meat, emanating from the flowers.  Many of the flowers also bear some physical resemblance to rotting animal carcasses, leading to their popular name of Carrion Flowers.  However, not all stapeliads smell bad, or attract flies.  Some species use beetles, bees, wasps, butterflies or moths as pollinators.  Stapeliad flowers range in size from mere millimetres in species of ""Echidnopsis"" and ""Pseudolithos"" to those of ""Stapelia gigantea"" that can reach 40 cm/16"" in diameter, and are some the largest of flowers to be found on any species of succulent."
172,Amanita smithiana,"Amanita smithiana, also known as Smith's amanita, is a species of agaric found on soil in coniferous (""Abies"", ""Tsuga"", ""Pseudotsuga"") and broadleaved (""Alnus"", ""Quercus"") woodland in the Pacific Northwest of North America.  It fruits in August and September."
173,Leptoceratopsidae,"Leptoceratopsidae is an extinct family of neoceratopsian dinosaurs from Asia and North America.  They resembled, and were closely related to, other neoceratopsians, such as the families Protoceratopsidae and Ceratopsidae, but they are more primitive and generally smaller.  Definitive leptoceratopsids have so far been found exclusively in the Late Cretaceous period (late Santonian - late Maastrichtian stages) of Asia and Western North America; however, material referred to leptoceratopsids from the early Campanian of North Carolina and possibly Sweden extends their geographic range into Eastern North America and potentially Europe.  A possible leptoceratopsid ulna, named ""Serendipaceratops"", has been found in Victoria, Australia.  However, a 2010 study showed that it could not be confidently referred to any ornithischian family, and is considered a ""nomen dubium""."
174,Hemlock woolly adelgid,"Hemlock woolly adelgid (""Adelges tsugae""), or HWA, is member of the Sternorrhyncha suborder of the Order Hemiptera and native to East Asia.  It feeds by sucking sap from hemlock and spruce trees (""Tsuga"" spp.; ""Picea"" spp.) .  In eastern North America, it is a destructive pest that gravely threatens the eastern hemlock (""Tsuga canadensis"") and the Carolina hemlock (""Tsuga caroliniana"").  Though the range of eastern hemlock extends north of the current range of the adelgid, it could spread to infect these northern areas as well.  Accidentally introduced to North America from Japan, HWA was first found in the eastern United States near Richmond, Virginia, in the early 1950s.  The pest has now been established in eighteen eastern states from Georgia to Massachusetts, causing widespread mortality of hemlock trees.  As of 2015, 90% of the geographic range of eastern hemlock in North America has been impacted by HWA."
175,Stem succulent,"Stem succulents are fleshy succulent columnar shaped plants which conduct photosynthesis mainly through stems not leaves.  They are related by form, but not by evolution.  They evolved to have similar forms and physiological characteristics by convergent evolution.  Examples are tall thin ""Euphorbias"" from deserts and arid regions southern African and Madagascar, similarly shaped cacti from North America and South America, which occupy a similar evolutionary niche, and members of two genera of the family Asclepiadaceae (""Hoodia"" and ""Stapelia"").  Shared features are a succulent stem that stores water and conducts photosynthesis, protective spines or thorns, no leaves (or highly reduced leaves), and use of CAM photosynthetisis (an opening of stomata and fixing CO2 almost exclusively at night)."
176,Pseudotsuga,"Pseudotsuga is a genus of evergreen coniferous trees in the family Pinaceae.  Common names include Douglas fir, Douglas-fir, Douglas tree, and Oregon pine. "" Pseudotsuga menziesii"" is widespread in western North America and is an important source of timber.  The number of species has long been debated, but two in western North America and two to four in eastern Asia are commonly acknowledged.  Nineteenth-century botanists had problems in classifying Douglas-firs, due to the species' similarity to various other conifers better known at the time; they have at times been classified in ""Pinus"", ""Picea"", ""Abies"", ""Tsuga"", and even ""Sequoia"".  Because of their distinctive cones, Douglas-firs were finally placed in the new genus ""Pseudotsuga"" (meaning ""false hemlock"") by the French botanist Carrière in 1867.  The genus name has also been hyphenated as ""Pseudo-tsuga""."
177,Celtis,"Celtis, commonly known as hackberries or nettle trees, is a genus of about 60–70 species of deciduous trees widespread in warm temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, in southern Europe, southern and eastern Asia, and southern and central North America, south to central Africa, and northern and central South America.  The genus is present in the fossil record at least since the Miocene of Europe, and Paleocene of North America and eastern Asia."
178,Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca,"Pseudotsuga menziesii"" var.  ""glauca, or Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, is an evergreen conifer native to the interior mountainous regions of western North America, from central British Columbia and southwest Alberta in Canada southward through the United States to the far north of Mexico.  The range is continuous in the northern Rocky Mountains south to eastern Washington, eastern Oregon, Idaho, western and south-central Montana and western Wyoming, but becomes discontinuous further south, confined to ""sky islands"" on the higher mountains in Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico, with only very isolated small populations in eastern Nevada, westernmost Texas, and northern Mexico.  It occurs from 600 m altitude in the north of the range, up to 3,000 m, rarely 3,200 m, in the south.  Further west towards the Pacific coast, it is replaced by the related coast Douglas-fir (""Pseudotsuga menziesii"" var.  ""menziesii""), and to the south, it is replaced by Mexican Douglas-fir in high mountains as far south as Oaxaca.  Some botanists have grouped Mexican Douglas-fir with ""P. menziesii"" var.  ""glauca"", but genetic and morphological evidence suggest that Mexican populations should be considered a different variety."
179,Huernia,"The genus Huernia (family Apocynaceae, subfamily Asclepiadoideae) consists of stem succulents from Eastern and Southern Africa, first described as a genus in 1810.  The flowers are five-lobed, usually somewhat more funnel- or bell-shaped than in the closely related genus ""Stapelia"", and often striped vividly in contrasting colours or tones, some glossy, others matt and wrinkled depending on the species concerned.  To pollinate, the flowers attract flies by emitting a scent similar to that of carrion.  The genus is considered close to the genera ""Stapelia"" and ""Hoodia"".  The name is in honour of Justin Heurnius (1587–1652) a Dutch missionary who is reputed to have been the first collector of South African Cape plants.  His name was actually mis-spelt by the collector."

Not much is known about Mehu's family.  The parents are unknown.  He has two wives, one called Nebet, the other one Neferkaus.  Mehu was bearing a high number of important titles.  These include the titles of the vizier, but he was also Overseer of the treasuries, overseer of the double granary, overseer of Upper Egypt and overseer of all royal works.  Several sons are mentioned in the tomb.  One son was perhaps called Mery, but his name was several times deleted.  Another son was Hetepka.  Within the mastaba of Mehu there are parts reserved for a vizier called Hetepka.  It is possible that he was the son of Mehu, albeit final evidence for this identification is missing.  The vizier Hetepka might have been just a member of Mehu's family.  Two other known children of Mehu are a daughter called Merut and a further son called Khuy."

Iuty’s tomb architecture has remained unpublished, but some objects of the burial equipment including faience and calcite shabtis as well as a calcite model scribe's palette have recently been studied.  Iuty cannot be dated precisely at present; but according to the German Egyptologist Jan Moje, he may have officiated during the 20th Dynasty.  A calcite canopic jar (representing Duamutef) belonging to Iuty’s son, the high-priest of Bastet, Ay, was also found in the same tomb.  Before this discovery Iuty was only known from a few objects seen at the beginning of the 20th century on the art market in Cairo."

Hapi was the son of Heru-ur and Isis or Serqet.  He is not to be confused with another god of the same name.  He is commonly depicted with the head of a hamadryas baboon, and is tasked with protecting the lungs of the deceased, hence the common depiction of a hamadryas baboon head sculpted as the lid of the canopic jar that held the lungs.  Hapi is in turn protected by the goddess Nephthys.  When his image appears on the side of a coffin, he is usually aligned with the side intended to face north.

Penre was in office between the reigning year 2 of Hatshepsut, when a certain Seni was still in office, and year 18, when Inebny/Amenemnekhu is attested in that office.  None of his monuments are dated, but one of his statues found in Nubia, must have been installed before the sole reign of Thutsmosis III.  His burial is a shaft tomb, little survive from the tomb chapel, that was made of mud brick.  The shaft was more than 11 meters deep.  In the burial chamber at the bottom of the shaft were found the human remains of three adults and two children.  Several objects of the burial equipment survived.

604,"National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)","The National Liberal Party (Romanian: ""Partidul Național Liberal"" , PNL) was the first organised political party in Romania, a major force in the country's politics from its foundation in 1875 to World War II.  Established in order to represent the interests of the nascent local bourgeoisie, until World War I it contested power with the Conservative Party, supported primarily by wealthy landowners, effectively creating a two-party system in a political system which severely limited the representation of the peasant majority through census suffrage.  Unlike its major opponent, the PNL managed to preserve its prominence after the implementation of universal male suffrage, playing an important role in shaping the institutional framework of ""Greater Romania"" during the 1920s.  Though initially opposed to the restoration of deposed King Carol II, it became increasingly supportive of his authoritarian policies, with PNL governments paving the way to a royal dictatorship in the late 1930s.  Formally disbanded along all political parties in 1938, party structures were preserved unofficially, with many party members also enlisting in Carol's National Renaissance Front.  Tolerated by the totalitarian government of Ion Antonescu, it eventually joined King Michael I and the Communist, National Peasants' and Social Democratic parties in overthrowing the dictator in the closing phase of World War II, enabling the reorganisation of the party in 1944.  Part of the first post-war grand coalition governments, it lost its importance as the new Communist-led coalition government used the denazification process in order to remove PNL supporters from government posts.  With the Communist-dominated government gaining the upper hand in local politics and starting to crack down on opposition, the party decided to cease political activity in the late 1940s, effectively disbanding itself.  After the overthrow of the Communist party rule in 1989, a new party was founded under the same name and assumed the National Liberal legacy."

606,Socialist Party of Transylvania,"The Socialist Party of Transylvania was a political party in Romania, active primarily in Transylvania.  Born out of the ethnic Romanian section of the Social Democratic Party of Hungary (MSZDP), it gradually attracted other socialist and social-democratic groups active in the Transleithanian lands of Austro-Hungary incorporated into the Kingdom of Romania after World War I.  Although initially it claimed, under the title Social Democratic Party of Transylvania and Banat, the adherence of the MSZDP party sections in Banat, the latter, while maintaining close links with the Transylvania party, constituted themselves as a distinct political organization.  The party also actively sought the cooperation of the socialist parties active in other regions of Romania, working towards a unified political party of the working class.  Such plans were however soon thwarted by repression from the part of the Romanian authorities, as well as disagreements both inside the party and among the different socialist formations of Romania.  The disagreements were further aggravated by the request of the Third International that the leaders of the party that had collaborated with the Romanian National Party be excluded from the merger, and eventually resulted in the split between the reformist social-democrats and the revolutionary-minded communists.  While the former decided to retire from unification talks and re-establish an independent Transyvanian party, the latter joined the majority of Socialist Party of Romania (PSR) to create the Communist Party of Romania in May 1921.  The social-democratic faction would late join the PSR members that disagreed with the new orientation of their party, founding the Romanian Social Democratic Party in 1927."

608,Tamil Arasu Kazhagam,"Tamil Arasu Kazhagam (Association for Tamil Autonomy) (Tamil: தமிழ் அரசு கழகம் ) was an Indian political party founded by M. P. Sivagnanam (Ma.  Po.  Si) in Tamil Nadu.  It was established as an association in 1946.  Its goals were to pressurize the Indian National Congress Government of the Madras Presidency to increase the use of Tamil in administration and education, to create an autonomous Tamil state out of a composite Madras Presidency and to soften the pro-Hindi stance of the Congress.  The association was allied with the Congress during 1946-54 and worked against the Dravidian Movement.  However, it grew closer to the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) over time.  During 1946-54, Sivagnanam was a member of the Congress.  He left the Congress in 1954 and turned the Tamil Arasu Kazhagam into an independent political party.  During 1957-60, it was involved in various protests over the drawing of state boundaries when Andhra Pradesh split from the composite Madras State.  It eventually became a part of DMK's electoral alliance in the 1967 assembly elections.  It was also involved in the movements to change the name of the state from Madras State to Tamil Nadu and to promote the use of Tamil over Sanskrit for conducting ""Archanai"" (Offerings to God) in Hindu temples.  In the 1967 elections, two candidates of the party (including Sivagnanam) were elected to the assembly contesting under DMK's ""Rising Sun"" Symbol.  The party was also an DMK ally in the 1971 assembly elections.  In 1972, it opposed the DMK chief minister M. Karunanidhi's decision to scrap prohibition laws and switched its allegiance to DMK's splinter group - the M. G. Ramachandran led Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (ADMK).  The party did not directly contest in elections after 1971 and Sivagnanam was nominated to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Council in 1972.

610,The History of the Norman Conquest of England,"The History of the Norman Conquest of England: Its Causes and Its Results (1867–1879) is a six-volume study of the Conquest by Edward A. Freeman.  Recognised by critics as a major work of scholarship on its first publication, it has since proved unpopular with readers, many of whom were put off by its enormous length and copious detail.  Academics have often criticized it for its heavily Whig treatment of the subject, and its glorification of Anglo-Saxon political and social institutions at the expense of their feudal successors, but its influence has nevertheless been profound, many Anglo-Norman historians of modern times having come around to some of Freeman's main conclusions."

613,History of Iowa,"Although Native Americans in the United States have resided in what is now Iowa for 13,000 years, the written history of Iowa begins with the proto-historic accounts of Native Americans by explorers such as Marquette and Joliet in the 1680s.  Until the early 19th century Iowa was occupied exclusively by Indians and a few European traders, with loose political control by France and Spain.  Iowa became part of the United States of America after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, but uncontested U.S. control over what is now Iowa occurred only after the War of 1812 and after a series of treaties eliminated Indian claims on the state.  Beginning in the 1830s Euro-American settlements appeared in the Iowa Territory, U.S. statehood was acquired in 1846, and by 1860 almost the entire state was settled and farmed by Euro-Americans.  Subsistence frontier farming was replaced by commodity farming after the construction of railroad networks in the 1850s and 1860s.  Iowa contributed a disproportionate amount of young men to fight in the American Civil War.  Afterwards they returned to help transform Iowa into an agricultural powerhouse, supplying food to the rest of the nation.  The industrialization of agriculture and the emergence of centralized commodities markets in the late 19th and 20th centuries led to a shift towards larger farms and the decline of the small family farm; this was exacerbated during the Great Depression.  Industrial production became a larger part of the economy during World War II and the postwar economic boom.  In the 1970s and 1980s a series of economic shocks, including the oil crisis, the 1980s farm crisis, and the Early 1980s recession led to the collapse of commodities prices, a decline in rural and state population, and rural flight.  Iowa's economy rebounded in the 1990s, emerging as a modern mixed economy dominated by industry, commerce, and finance, in which agriculture is a comparatively small component.  Iowa's population is now predominately urban and has been increasing since the 1990s at a faster rate than the U.S. as a whole, although rural flight continues to be a problem."

616,Major Crimes Act,"The Major Crimes Act (U.S. Statutes at Large, 23:385) is a law passed by the United States Congress in 1885 as the final section of the Indian Appropriations Act of that year.  The law places certain crimes under federal jurisdiction if they are committed by a Native American in Native territory.  The law follows the 1817 General Crimes Act, which extended federal jurisdiction to crimes committed in Native territory but did not cover crimes committed by Native Americans against Native Americans.  The Major Crime Act therefore broadened federal jurisdiction in Native territory by extending it to some crimes committed by Native Americans against Native Americans.  The Major Crimes Act was passed by Congress in response to the Supreme Court of the United States's ruling in ""Ex parte Crow Dog"" (109 U.S. 556 (1883)) that overturned the federal court conviction of Brule Lakota sub-chief Crow Dog for the murder of principal chief Spotted Tail on the Rosebud Indian Reservation."

618,Windrose Site,"The Windrose Site is a 19th-century Potawatomi village site in Kankakee County, Illinois.  The site is likely associated with a Potawatomi village named ""Rock"" or ""Little Rock""; it was occupied from circa 1775 until the Potawatomi were forcibly removed from Illinois in the 1830s.  Many of the artifacts recovered from the site are related to the fur trade, a large part of the Potawatomi economy and a source of cultural interaction between the Potawatomi and Europeans.  The majority of the artifacts reflect traditional Potawatomi culture, including smoking pipes used for religious rituals.  Items deriving from the U.S. government's efforts at the time to force European culture upon Native Americans represent less than 5% of those found at the site, a sign that these efforts were not particularly successful with the Potawatomi."

The show was a limited engagement of 12 performances at Broadway's Lunt-Fontanne Theatre from November 2 through 13, 2016."
762,Sacking of Lawrence,"The Siege of Lawrence occurred on May 21, 1856, when pro-slavery activists attacked and ransacked the town of Lawrence, Kansas, which had been founded by anti-slavery settlers to help ensure that Kansas would become a ""free state"".  The incident made worse the guerrilla war in Kansas Territory that became known as Bleeding Kansas."
763,Free-Stater (Kansas),"Free-Staters were those settlers in Kansas Territory during the Bleeding Kansas era in the 1850s who opposed the extension of slavery to Kansas.  The name derives from the term ""free state"", that is, a U.S. state without slavery."
764,Pottawatomie massacre,"The Pottawatomie massacre occurred during the night of May 24 and the morning of May 25, 1856.  In reaction to the sacking of Lawrence, Kansas by pro-slavery forces, John Brown and a band of abolitionist settlers—some of them members of the Pottawatomie Rifles—killed five settlers north of Pottawatomie Creek in Franklin County, Kansas.  This was one of the many bloody episodes in Kansas preceding the American Civil War, which came to be known collectively as Bleeding Kansas.  Bleeding Kansas was largely brought about by the Missouri Compromise and the Kansas–Nebraska Act."
765,New England Emigrant Aid Company,"The New England Emigrant Aid Company (originally the Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Company) was a transportation company in Boston, Massachusetts, created to transport immigrants to the Kansas Territory to shift the balance of power so that Kansas would enter the United States as a free state, rather than a slave state.  Created by Eli Thayer in the wake of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which allowed the population of Kansas Territory to choose whether slavery would be legal, the Company is noted less for its direct impact than for the psychological impact it had on proslavery and antislavery elements.  Thayer's prediction that the Company would eventually be able to send 20,000 immigrants a year never came to fruition, but it spurred Border Ruffians from nearby Missouri, where slavery was legal, to move to Kansas to ensure its admission to the Union as a slave state.  That, in turn, further galvanized Free-Staters and enemies of Slave Power."
766,John Brown (abolitionist),"John Brown (May 9, 1800 – December 2, 1859) was an American abolitionist who believed and advocated that armed insurrection was the only way to overthrow the institution of slavery in the United States.  Brown first gained attention when he led small groups of volunteers during the Bleeding Kansas crisis of 1856.  Dissatisfied with the pacifism of the organized abolitionist movement, he said, ""These men are all talk.  What we need is action—action!""  During the Kansas campaign, Brown commanded forces at the Battle of Black Jack and the Battle of Osawatomie.  He and his supporters killed five supporters of slavery in the Pottawatomie massacre of May 1856 in response to the sacking of Lawrence by pro-slavery forces."
767,Martin F. Conway,"Martin Franklin Conway (November 19, 1827 – February 15, 1882) was a U.S. congressman, consul to France, abolitionist, and advocate of the Free-State movement in Kansas."
768,Kansas–Nebraska Act,"The Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854 (10 Stat.  277 ) created the territories of Kansas and Nebraska and was drafted by Democratic Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois and President Franklin Pierce.  The initial purpose of the Kansas–Nebraska Act was to open up thousands of new farms and make feasible a Midwestern Transcontinental Railroad.  The popular sovereignty clause of the law led pro- and anti-slavery elements to flood into Kansas with the goal of voting slavery up or down, resulting in Bleeding Kansas."
769,Marais des Cygnes massacre,"The Marais des Cygnes massacre ( , , or ) is considered the last significant act of violence in Bleeding Kansas prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War.  On May 19, 1858, approximately 30 men led by Charles Hamilton, a Georgian native and proslavery leader, crossed into the Kansas Territory from Missouri.  They arrived at Trading Post, Kansas, in the morning and then headed back to Missouri.  Along the way they captured 11 Free-Staters, none of whom were armed and, it is said, none of whom had participated in the ongoing violence.  Most of the men knew Hamilton and apparently did not realize he meant them harm.  These prisoners were led into a defile, where Hamilton ordered the men to shoot.  He even shot and fired the first bullet himself.  Five men were killed."
770,Wyandotte Constitution,"The present Constitution of the State of Kansas was originally known as the Wyandotte Constitution to distinguish it from earlier proposed state constitutions.  Drawn up at Wyandotte (now part of Kansas City) in July 1859, it was the fourth constitution voted on by the people of Kansas Territory, as the battle between proslavery and antislavery forces during the Bleeding Kansas era spread to the debate over the terms of the new state's charter."
771,Wakarusa War,"The Wakarusa War was a skirmish that took place in Kansas Territory during November and December 1855 as part of the Bleeding Kansas violence.  It centered on Lawrence, Kansas, and the Wakarusa River Valley."
772,Nobel Prize in Literature,"Since 1901, the Nobel Prize in Literature (Swedish: ""Nobelpriset i litteratur"" ) has been awarded annually to an author from any country who has, in the words of the will of Alfred Nobel, produced ""in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction"" (original Swedish: ""den som inom litteraturen har producerat det mest framstående verket i en idealisk riktning"").  Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, here ""work"" refers to an author's work as a whole.  The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize in any given year.  The academy announces the name of the chosen laureate in early October.  It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895; the others are the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Physics, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine."

Starting from Rainwater's concept of an irregular-shaped liquid drop model of the nucleus, Bohr and Mottelson developed a detailed theory that was in close agreement with experiments.  Since his father, Niels Bohr, had won the prize in 1922, he and his father were one of the six pairs of fathers and sons who have both won the Nobel Prize and one of the four pairs who have both won the Nobel Prize in Physics."
779,William Henry Bragg,"Sir William Henry Bragg (2 July 1862 – 12 March 1942) was a British physicist, chemist, mathematician and active sportsman who uniquely shared a Nobel Prize with his son William Lawrence Bragg – the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics: """"for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays"""".

783,Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft,"Gemeinschaft (] ) and Gesellschaft (] ), generally translated as ""community and society"", are categories which were used by the German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies in order to categorize social ties into two dichotomous sociological types which define each other.  Max Weber, who is generally recognized as being a founding figure in sociology, also wrote extensively about the relationship between ""Gemeinschaft"" and ""Gesellschaft"".  Weber wrote in direct response to Tönnies."
784,Science as a Vocation,"Science as a Vocation (German: ""Wissenschaft als Beruf"") is the text of a lecture given in 1917 at Munich University by German sociologist and political economist Max Weber.  The original version was published in German, but at least two translations in English exist.  ""Science as a Vocation"" is the first of the two ""Vocation"" lectures Weber delivered.  The second lecture was ""Politics as a Vocation"" which was delivered in January 1919, also in Munich."
785,Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act,"The Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE or the Access Act, Pub.  L. No. 103-259, 108 Stat.  694) (May 26, 1994, ) is a United States law that was signed by President Bill Clinton in May 1994, which prohibits the following three things: (1) the use of physical force, threat of physical force, or physical obstruction to intentionally injure, intimidate, interfere with or attempt to injure, intimidate or interfere with any person who is obtaining reproductive health services or providing reproductive health services (this portion of the law typically refers to abortion clinics), (2) the use of physical force, threat of physical force, or physical obstruction to intentionally injure, intimidate, interfere with or attempt to injure, intimidate or interfere with any person who is exercising or trying to exercise their First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship, (3) the intentional damage or destruction of a reproductive health care facility or a place of worship."
786,Legitimation crisis,"Legitimation crisis refers to a decline in the confidence of administrative functions, institutions, or leadership.  The term was first introduced in 1973 by Jürgen Habermas, a German sociologist and philosopher.  Habermas expanded upon the concept, claiming that with a legitimation crisis, an institution or organization does not have the administrative capabilities to maintain or establish structures effective in achieving their end goals.  The term itself has been generalized by other scholars to refer not only to the political realm, but to organizational and institutional structures as well.  While there is not unanimity among social scientists when claiming that a legitimation crisis exists, a predominant way of measuring a legitimation crisis is to consider public attitudes toward the organization in question."
787,Hamlet and His Problems,"Hamlet and His Problems is an essay written by T.S. Eliot in 1919 that offers a critical reading of ""Hamlet"".  The essay first appeared in Eliot's ""The Sacred Wood: Essays on Poetry and Criticism"" in 1920.  It was later reprinted by Faber & Faber in 1932 in ""Selected Essays, 1917-1932"".  Eliot's critique gained attention partly due to his claim that ""Hamlet"" is ""most certainly an artistic failure"".  Eliot also popularised the concept of the objective correlative—a mechanism used to evoke emotion in an audience—in the essay.  The essay is also an example of Eliot's use of what became known as new criticism."
788,Monopoly on violence,"The monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force, also known as the monopoly on violence (German: ""Gewaltmonopol des Staates"" ), is a core concept of modern public law, which goes back to Jean Bodin's 1576 work ""Les Six livres de la République"" and Thomas Hobbes' 1651 book ""Leviathan"".  As the defining conception of the state, it was first described in sociology by Max Weber in his essay ""Politics as a Vocation"" (1919).  Weber claims that the state is the ""only human Gemeinschaft which lays claim to the monopoly on the legitimated use of physical force.  However, this monopoly is limited to a certain geographical area, and in fact this limitation to a particular area is one of the things that defines a state.""  In other words, Weber describes the state as any organization that succeeds in holding the exclusive right to use, threaten, or authorize physical force against residents of its territory.  Such a monopoly, according to Weber, must occur via a process of legitimation."
789,Max Weber,"Maximilian Karl Emil ""Max"" Weber (] ; 21 April 1864 – 14 June 1920) was a German sociologist, philosopher, jurist, and political economist.  His ideas profoundly influenced social theory and social research.  Weber is often cited, with Émile Durkheim and Karl Marx, as among the three founders of sociology.  Weber was a key proponent of methodological antipositivism, arguing for the study of social action through interpretive (rather than purely empiricist) means, based on understanding the purpose and meaning that individuals attach to their own actions.  Unlike Durkheim, he did not believe in monocausality and rather proposed that for any outcome there can be multiple causes."
790,Ferdinand Tönnies,"Ferdinand Tönnies (] ; 26 July 1855, near Oldenswort, Eiderstedt, North Frisia, Schleswig – 9 April 1936, Kiel, Germany) was a German sociologist and philosopher.

812,European science in the Middle Ages,"European science in the Middle Ages comprised the study of nature, mathematics and natural philosophy in medieval Europe.  Following the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the decline in knowledge of Greek, Christian Western Europe was cut off from an important source of ancient learning.  Although a range of Christian clerics and scholars from Isidore and Bede to Buridan and Oresme maintained the spirit of rational inquiry, Western Europe would see a period of scientific decline during the Early Middle Ages.  However, by the time of the High Middle Ages, the region had rallied and was on its way to once more taking the lead in scientific discovery (see Scientific Revolution)."
813,History of schools in Scotland,"The history of schools in Scotland includes the development of all schools as institutions and buildings in Scotland, from the early Middle Ages to the present day.  From the early Middle Ages there were bardic schools, that trained individuals in the poetic and musical arts.  Monasteries served as major repositories of knowledge and education, often running schools.  In the High Middle Ages, new sources of education arose including choir and grammar schools designed to train priests.  Benedictine and Augustinian foundations probably had charitable almonry schools to educate young boys, who might enter the priesthood.  Some abbeys opened their doors to teach the sons of gentlemen.  By the end of the Middle Ages, grammar schools could be found in all the main burghs and some small towns.  In rural areas there were petty or reading schools that provided an elementary education.  Private tuition in the families of lords and wealthy burghers sometimes developed into ""household schools"".  Girls of noble families were taught in nunneries and by the end of the fifteenth century Edinburgh also had schools for girls, sometimes described as ""sewing schools"".  There is documentary evidence for about 100 schools of these different kinds before the Reformation.  The growing humanist-inspired emphasis on education cumulated with the passing of the Education Act 1496."
814,Holy Roman Empire,"The Holy Roman Empire (Latin: ""Sacrum Imperium Romanum"" ; German: ""Heiliges Römisches Reich"" ) was a multi-ethnic complex of territories in central Europe that developed during the Early Middle Ages and continued until its dissolution in 1806.  The largest territory of the empire after 962 was the Kingdom of Germany, though it also came to include the Kingdom of Bohemia, the Kingdom of Burgundy, the Kingdom of Italy, and numerous other territories."
815,Friesian horse,"The Friesian (also Frizian) is a horse breed originating in Friesland, in the Netherlands.  Although the conformation of the breed resembles that of a light draught horse, Friesians are graceful and nimble for their size.  It is believed that during the Middle Ages, ancestors of Friesian horses were in great demand as war horses throughout continental Europe.  Through the Early Middle Ages and High Middle Ages, their size enabled them to carry a knight in armour.  In the Late Middle Ages, heavier, draught type animals were needed.  Though the breed nearly became extinct on more than one occasion, the modern day Friesian horse is growing in numbers and popularity, used both in harness and under saddle.  Most recently, the breed is being introduced to the field of dressage."
816,Early Slavs,"The early Slavs were a diverse group of tribal societies who lived during the Migration Period and Early Middle Ages (approximately the fifth to the tenth centuries) in Eastern Europe and in Central Europe and established the foundations for the Slavic nations through the Slavic states of the High Middle Ages.  The first written use of the name ""Slavs"" dates to the sixth century, when the Slavic tribes inhabited a large portion of Central and Eastern Europe.  By that century, native Iranian ethnic groups (the Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans) had been absorbed by the region's Slavic population.  Over the next two centuries, the Slavs expanded southwest toward the Balkans and the Alps and northeast towards the Volga River."
817,History of the Jews in France,"The history of the Jews in France deals with the Jews and Jewish communities in France.  There has been a Jewish presence in France since at least the early Middle Ages.  France was a center of Jewish learning in the Middle Ages, but persecution increased as the Middle Ages wore on, including multiple expulsions and returns.  During the late 18th century French Revolution, France was the first country in Europe to emancipate its Jewish population.

818,Medieval archaeology,"Medieval archaeology is the study of humankind through its material culture, specialising in the period of the European Middle Ages.  At its broadest, the period stretches from the 5th to the 16th century and refers to post-Roman but pre-modern remains.  The period covers the upheaval caused by the fall of the Roman Empire and cultures such as the Vikings, Saxons, and Franks.  Archaeologists often specialise in studying either the Early Middle Ages (Migration Period) or the High Middle Ages and Late Middle Ages, although many projects and professionals move across these chronological boundaries.  The rich nature of the medieval written record has meant that archaeology has often been seen as the ""handmaiden to history"", especially in the later medieval period.  Analysis of material culture may enrich or call into question written evidence from the medieval period and the two sources of evidence need to be used together.  Medieval archaeology has examined the development of medieval settlements, particularly the development of medieval towns and castles.  It has also contributed to understanding of the spread and development of Christian monasticism during the medieval period."
819,High Middle Ages,"The High Middle Ages or High Medieval Period was the period of European history around the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries ( 10011300).  The High Middle Ages are preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention end around 1500."
820,Early Middle Ages,"The Early Middle Ages (or early medieval period), lasting from the 5th to the 10th century CE, marked the start of the Middle Ages of European history.  The Early Middle Ages followed the decline of the Western Roman Empire and preceded the High Middle Ages (c. 10th to 13th centuries).  The Early Middle Ages largely overlap with Late Antiquity.  The term ""Late Antiquity"" is used to emphasize elements of continuity with the Roman Empire, while ""Early Middle Ages"" is used to emphasize developments characteristic of the later medieval period."

833,2008–09 Phoenix Suns season,"The 2008–09 Phoenix Suns season was the 41st season of the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA).  The season was to be a promising one, filled with All-Star talent at several positions.  It was believed over the offseason, the Suns would be able to better incorporate Shaquille O'Neal, who necessitated changes to both the offense and defense after being obtained in a trade one season ago.  It was also the first season head coach Terry Porter had been able to use the summer to implement his defensive approach for a team which had in seasons past scored a large number of their points off fast breaks and early in the shot clock.  Sensing a need for change, team management traded for scorer Jason Richardson in December, but this did not appear to immediately reinvigorate an offense that had recently led the league in points per game.  However, after Phoenix went 28–23 to start the season, Suns assistant Alvin Gentry was named to replace Porter as head coach.  Less than one week after the All-Star Game, Amar'e Stoudemire sustained a season-ending eye injury while the improvement of the team never fully came.  The Suns finished 46–36, second in the Pacific division but out the playoffs for the first time since Steve Nash rejoined the Suns in the 2004–05 season."

Cotton Fitzsimmons, Suns head coach for the '70–'71 and '71–'72 seasons, returned to the franchise where he got his first head coaching position.  The Suns also enjoyed the benefits of a trade which brought Tom Chambers to the Valley of the Sun, who would have an All-Star season his first year in Phoenix.  The Suns' regular seasons successes were carried on through the playoffs, sweeping Denver in the first round and defeating Golden State four games to one in the Western Conference Semifinals.  The Suns saw their playoff fortunes reverse in the Conference Finals when they met the season's MVP Magic Johnson and the top-seeded Los Angeles Lakers, getting swept four games to zero.  All home games were played at Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum."
835,1999–2000 Phoenix Suns season,"The 1999–2000 NBA season was the 32nd season for the National Basketball Association's Phoenix Suns.  During the offseason, the Suns acquired All-Star guard Anfernee Hardaway from the Orlando Magic, and signed free agent Rodney Rogers while re-signing former Suns center Oliver Miller.  Scott Skiles would come on as head coach, replacing Danny Ainge after a 13–7 start to the season.

Head coach Alvin Gentry, who coached the Suns the final 31 games during the previous season, was looking to reinstill the offensive tendencies the Suns had developed in seasons past, using the strengths of Steve Nash and Amar'e Stoudemire.  A season and a half experiment with Shaquille O'Neal ended in the summer before the season, coupled with the retention of Jason Richardson, and the Suns were primed for a return to the playoffs after a one-season absence.  Phoenix would be the only team in the league to hit 40% or more of their three-point field goal percentage while leading the NBA in scoring at 110 points per contest.  They would return to the playoffs, defeating the Portland Trail Blazers in six games and sweeping the rivaled San Antonio Spurs in four.

The ensuing playoff run took plenty by surprise, including a seven-game series win against the Western Conference's top seed Golden State Warriors, a team that had finished 17 games ahead of the Suns in the divisional standings.  The franchise's first Finals appearance pitted them against a 12-time champion in the Boston Celtics, whose roster featured three players from that season's All-Star Game.  The 1976 NBA Finals would feature a memorable Game 5 triple-overtime thriller filled with controversies in which the Suns narrowly lost.  Returning home for Game 6, the demoralized Suns would lose Game 6 and the series but not before endearing a generation of fans to the Suns franchise and showcasing a basketball from the desert southwest.

The phrase retrometabolic drug design was coined by Nicholas Bodor.  The method is analogous to retrosynthetic analysis where the synthesis of a target molecule is planned backwards.  In retrometabolic drug design, metabolic reaction information of drugs is used to design parent drugs whose metabolism and distribution can be controlled to target and eliminate the drug to increase efficacy and minimize undesirable side effects.  The new drugs thus designed achieve selective organ and/or therapeutic site drug targeting and produce safe therapeutic agents and safe environmental chemicals.  These approaches represent systematic methodologies that thoroughly integrate structure-activity (SAR) and structure-metabolism (SMR) relationships and are aimed at designing safe, locally active compounds with improved therapeutic index (ratio of benefit vs. side effect)."

1031,Andrew Gray (17th-century divine),"Gray was born in a house still standing on the north side of the Lawnmarket, Edinburgh, in August 1633 (bap.  reg.  23).  He was fourth son and eleventh child in a family of twenty-one, his father being Sir William Gray of Pittendrum (died 1648), an eminent merchant and royalist, descended from Andrew, first lord Gray.  His mother was Geils or Egidia Smyth, sister to Sir John Smyth of Grothill, at one time provost of Edinburgh.  Andrew in his childhood was playful and fond of pleasure; but while he was quite young his thoughts were suddenly given a serious turn by reflecting on the piety of a beggar whom he met near Leith.  Resolved to enter the ministry, he studied at the universities both of St. Andrews and Edinburgh.  He graduated at the former in 1651.  Gray was one of that band of youthful preachers who were powerfully influenced by the venerable Leighton.  His talents and learning favourably impressed Principal Gillespie.  He was licensed to preach in 1653, and was ordained to the collegiate charge of the Outer High Church of Glasgow on 3 Nov. 1653, although only in his twenty-first year, notwithstanding some remonstrance.  One of the remonstrants, Robert Baillie, refers in his ""Letters and Journals"" to the ‘high flown, rhetorical style’ of the youthful preacher, and describes his ordination as taking place ‘over the belly of the town's protestation.’  His ministry proved eminently successful, and although only of three years' duration, in the profound impression produced during his lifetime, and the sustained popularity of his published works, Gray had few rivals in the Scottish church.  He died on 8 Feb. 1656, after a brief illness, of a ‘purple’ fever, and was interred in Blackadder's or St. Fergus's Aisle, Glasgow Cathedral.  On the walls of the aisle his initials and date of death may be seen deeply incised.  Gray married Rachael, daughter of Robert Baillie of Jerviswood, and had a son, William, born at Glasgow in March 1655, who probably died young.  He had also a daughter, Rachael, who was served heir to her father on 26 June 1669.  His widow remarried George Hutcheson, minister at Irvine."

Ulster unionists, determined to prevent any measure of home rule for Ireland, formed a paramilitary force, the Ulster Volunteers, which threatened to resist by physical force the implementation of the Act and the authority of any Dublin Parliament by force of arms.  Irish nationalists responded by setting up the Irish Volunteers ""to secure the rights and liberties common to all the people of Ireland"".  Both sides then began importing weapons and ammunition from Germany, in the Larne gun-running and Howth gun-running incidents.  HM Government's ability to face down unionist defiance was thrown into question by the ""Curragh incident"", when dozens of British Army officers tendered their resignation rather than secure arms against Ulster loyalist seizure, forcing a climb-down by the government.  The crisis was temporarily averted by the outbreak of World War I.  The Home Rule Bill was enacted, but its implementation was suspended for the duration of the war."

1225,Nashville Terminal Subdivision,"The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation in the U.S. State of Tennessee.  The Subdivision is broken up into 5 sections all in Nashville, Tennessee.  The northern part of the Terminal is in Madison, Tennessee at milepost 000/0BA 174 on the southern end of the Ex-L&N Mainline Subdivision at Monfort.  Disptach for the Mainline Sub is known as ""LD"" which is part of the Cincinnati Division.  From here in Madison begins the double track that stays for another 22 miles south to Brentwood, Tennessee.  At milepost 000/0BA/00H 176.6, the famous Johnny Cash ""Amqui"" location where the Ex-L&N Evansville, Indiana line, the Henderson Subdivision meets with the Terminal.  Dispatch for the Henderson Sub is known as ""SA"" and operates on AAR58.  There are two crossings near each other, Williams Ave and Nesbitt Lane at Amqui.  From here the Terminal goes south about 2 miles to the Nashville National Cemetery to the first major location, known as Ekin, 000179, where there is a cross over track from number 1 to number 2 track (left to right track).  There is also the first EDD (Defect Detector) at 000179.1.  Few more miles southward, the next major location appears.  At 000181.0, Maplewood is a major location for the Terminal.  From here the regular Terminal goes south to swap crews at Kayne Ave, and the right side, Radnor Cutoff, detours the city and gives yard departures and arrivals direct access to and from Radnor yard to cities like Louisville and Chicago.  The Cutoff runs from Maplewood to Shelby Park double track.  From Shebly the track converges into one to pass the historic Shelby bridge, then it opens back to double track.  From there, the cutoff hits the Intermediates at 0BA187.0 known as Chicken Pike.  The Radnor Cutoff carries the L&N mainline classification of ""0BA"" but meets the main at the same milepost from the Terminal.  At Chicken Pike, trains are staged to await arrival to Radnor yard.  Once they get clearance, speed is decreased to 15, and at 0BA188.1 the EDD (Defect Detector) sounds for departures and arrivals.  This location is known as North Radnor.  The right track diverging from the #2 is known as A-1, it is for departure trains to Chattanooga and Atlanta.  The left track which goes west from the #1 is known as A-2, and serves as a departure track to Memphis, and if the cutoff is out of service, all northbound departures.  The interesting piece of Maplewood is the crossovers that are there to move trains from the Cutoff to the Main.  Both lines remain double track for a while.  The main runs south for 2 more miles until the Intermediate signals at 000183.0.  Commonly trains will stop before Delmas Ave when Kayne Ave is at capacity and await dispatch permission before moving south.  From here, the main continues south until the CR Cumberland River Swingbridge, where the main converges into a single track shortly to cross the bridge.  At this point, trains had been running at track speed of around 40.  From the drawbridge into town, speed is reduced to around 10.  After the bridge is passed, the main returns to double track in downtown.  On the #1 track about a half a mile south, another connecting track is present.  This is the Wye track that connects the main with the Bruceton side, while rarely used for mainline trains, locals and river jobs use it.  The location is known as 8th Avenue or 8th Avenue Wye.  The main then runs down to Kayne Ave, the central hotbed of all Nashville thru traffic.  The Memphis, Tennessee Ex-L&N Bruceton Subdivision meets with the Terminal.  The Bruceton Sub begins at Church Street at 00N0.0.  The line then runs single track until 00N0.7 ""11th Avenue"" where it turns into double track and also meets the aforementioned, Wye track.  The Bruceton line then goes southwest a while to the next signals, at ""Shops"".  Now speed has been increased.  The line is still double track until ""Sellars"", where speed is increased to 40 and jurisdiction transferred to the SD Dispatcher.  For a short time, 4 main tracks are present and an additional fifth track for switchers and yard movements.  The tracks from left to right in Kayne Ave are as follows: 100, 99, 98, 12, 3.  The Kayne Ave yard is also here in this area, which houses some frieght and some switcher engines.  The tracks to the old shed are covered and removed.  The Union Station is not an active station, but a historic hotel.  Crew change usually occurs at the ""walkway"" which is under the Demombreun St bridge by the Kayne Ave Tower.  This is also where the Ex-NC&StL Chattanooga Subdivision begins.  Then tracks run south to Fogg St/South End where things get complicated.  At milepost 000/0BA/00J187 the 98 track merges into the 12 track, making for 3 tracks now.  There is a crossover from 99 to 12, also a crossover from 12 to 3.  About 2/10ths of a mile down the 99 merges into the 12 track reducing the tracks back to the regular double.  About 4/10ths of a mile down the line from Fogg St, 000187.4, Oak St, is a crossover track from #2 to #1 (the track names are no longer 3 and 12, but are back to regular names).  When trains use this crossover northbound, such as Memphis bound trains from the A-2 line, they refer to it as ""Long Lead"".  And now, the Terminal splits into two parts.  The right side turns into a single track shortly, and will become the Chattanooga Subdivision, and the left side runs south to Brentwood.  The right track runs single shortly until double track for a while.  This begins part of the Chattanooga Sub or J-Line.  The #2 meets with the A-2 connection track at 00J2.2 known as A-2.  Speed is now increased to 40.  Commonly northbounds will stage at 4th Ave on the #1 to await clearance.  Now about a mile down the #1 meets the A-1 connection line.  At 00J3.6 known as A-1.  Further down the double track ends at Glencliff (00J4.9).  Now it runs single for three miles until it hits Danley, which has the D Line connection track, which is an arrival track for incoming Radnor trains from the J Line.  At Danley, the Terminal ends but the same dispatcher handles traffic, ""SC"".  At Oak Street, our main terminal line goes south two miles to 000189.0 known as Criaghead or Vine Hill.  There is a crossover here from #1 to #2 track.  And there is also a connection/delivery track to the Nashville and Eastern Railroad which connects the Tennessee Central Railroad Museum to a major railroad.  Trains sometimes stop on the #2 before Craighead if they are waiting to enter Radnor yard.  Sometimes trains wait on the #1 at the Berry Road crossing if they await arrival to Kayne Ave. At this point, speed has been increased to 30 from 10.  Moving south, the line hits Radnor Yard at 000192.  The #2 track meets the E-Line arrival track which most Memphis trains and locals use.  The B-Line which meets the #1 track is used for departures out of the C yard and local jobs.  At Mayton, 000192.3, the B line meets the #1 track, and there is a crossover track from #2 to #1.  Speed is now at 40.  2 miles south, at 000194.0, South Radnor, the next intersection is present.  This is where the Radnor A yard meets the main.  There is a single departure/arrival track that meets the #2 track along with a crossover from #1 to #2 track.  Commonly, the #2 track south of the signals is used to halt trains.  This location is known as TVA, because of the power station that is adjacent.  From here the Terminal runs about 2.5 miles south until we hit the southern tip.  The tracks converge onto one single main, at 000/0BA196.6 known as Brentwood.  Speed is increased to 50 and jurisdiction to the S.E. dispatcher.  The right track is the main, S&NA North, while the left track is the Nashville Subdivision which runs to Columbia and exchanges freight with the TSRR.  The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is one of the busiest locations on the CSX network, and one of the most important."

Information cascades provide an explanation for how such situations can occur, how likely they are to cascade incorrect information or actions, how such behavior may arise and desist rapidly, and how effective attempts to originate a cascade tend to be under different conditions.  By explaining all of these things, the original Independent Cascade model sought to improve on previous models that were unable to explain cascades of irrational behavior, a cascade's fragility, or the short-lived nature of certain cascades."

Unlike Holinshed's incompetent King Duncan (who is credited in the narrative with a ""feeble and slothful administration""), Shakespeare's King Duncan is crafted as a sensitive, insightful, and generous father-figure whose murder grieves Scotland and is accounted the cause of turmoil in the natural world."

The conflicts involved numerous nominally independent rulers and their vassals, struggles for succession and territory, and included a diplomatic and military struggle between the French East India Company and the British East India Company.  They were mainly fought on the territories in India which were dominated by the Nizam of Hyderabad up to the Godavari delta.  As a result of these military contests, the British East India Company established its dominance among the European trading companies within India.  The French company was pushed to a corner and was confined primarily to Pondichéry.  The East India company's dominance eventually led to control by the British Company over most of India and eventually to the establishment of the British Raj."

The British eventually overran the Dutch forces at Chinsura and played a major role in replacing Mir Jafar with Mir Qasim.

1506,Jute trade,"The jute trade is centred mainly around Bangladesh and the Indian State of West Bengal.  The major producing country of jute is Bangladesh, due to its natural fertile soil.  Bengal Jute was taken to Europe early in the 17th century by the Dutch and the French and later by the East India Company to Britain.  By the 1790s a much larger trade had developed in the Scottish city of Dundee, the European home of jute spinners.  Introduced to the British by the East India Company, crude fibre was the bulk still exported from Bengal after 1790, but a thriving trade did not really begin until after 1850 through mechanised processing, to meet rising demand.  Raw jute was imported from Bengal by the British East India Company.  British Jute Barons grew rich processing jute and selling manufactured products made from jute.  Dundee Jute Barons and the British East India Company began to set up jute mills in Bengal and by 1895 jute industries in Bengal overtook the Scottish jute trade.  Many Scots emigrated to Bengal to set up jute factories.  More than a billion jute sandbags were exported from Bengal to the trenches during World War I and even more during WWII and also exported to the Americas, especially the United States southern region to bag cotton and coffee.  It was used in the fishing, construction, art and in the arms industry.  India, China, Thailand, Myanmar also produce Jute in low quantities.  India is one of the largest importers of Jute in South Asia and also produces processed jute products in the world, while Bangladesh is the largest producer and exporter of raw jute.  Therefore, the local price of raw jute in Bangladesh is the international price.  Ironically, the local price of jute goods produced in India set their own price."
1507,Indian Rebellion of 1857,"The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major, but ultimately unsuccessful, uprising in India in 1857–58 against the rule of the British East India Company, which functioned as a sovereign power on behalf of the British Crown.  The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the Company's army in the garrison town of Meerut, 40 miles northeast of Delhi (now Old Delhi).  It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India, though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east.  The rebellion posed a considerable threat to British power in that region, and was contained only with the rebels' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858.  On 1 November 1858, the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder, though they did not declare the hostilities formally to have ended until 8 July 1859.  The rebellion is known by many names, including the Sepoy Mutiny, the Indian Mutiny, the Great Rebellion, the Revolt of 1857, the Indian Insurrection, and India's First War of Independence."

In the process, he also turned himself into a multi-millionaire.  Together with Warren Hastings he was one of the key early figures setting in motion what would later become British India.  Blocking impending French mastery of India, and eventual British expulsion from the continent, Clive improvised a military expedition that ultimately enabled the East India Company to adopt the French strategy of indirect rule via puppet government.  Hired by the company to return a second time to India, Clive conspired to secure the Company's trade interests by overthrowing the locally unpopular heir to the throne of ""Bengal,"" the richest state in India, richer than Britain, at the time.  Back in England, he sat as a Tory Member of Parliament in London."

His rule is widely considered the start of British imperialism in India and was a key step in the eventual British domination of vast areas of the subcontinent.  Siraj ud-Daulah, the previous Nawab of Bengal along with his army were defeated and killed in the Battle of Plassey by the British due to the betrayal of the commander of Siraj ud-Daulah′s army, Mir Jafar, who betrayed Siraj ud-Daulah to become the next Nawab.  Thus after helping the British defeat Siraj ud-Daulah he became the new Nawab of Bengal in 1757 with military support from the British East India Company as a reward for his betrayal.  However, Jafar failed to satisfy constant British demands for money.  In 1758, Robert Clive discovered that through his agent Khoja Wajid, Jafar had made a treaty with the Dutch at Chinsurah.  Dutch ships of war were also seen in the River Hooghly.  Circumstances led to the Battle of Chinsurah.  British company official Henry Vansittart proposed that since Jafar was unable to cope with the difficulties, Mir Qasim, Jafar's son-in-law, should act as Deputy Subahdar.  In October 1760, the company forced him to abdicate in favor of Qasim.  However, Qasim's independent spirit and plan to force the East India company out of his dominion led to his overthrow, and Jafar was restored as the Nawab in 1763 with the support of the company.  Mir Qasim however refused to accept this and went to war against the company.  Jafar ruled until his death on 17 January 1765 and lies buried at the Jafarganj Cemetery in Murshidabad, West Bengal, India."

1662,Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel,"Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U.S. 498 (1998), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act (Coal Act) constituted an unconstitutional regulatory taking of property which required the Act to be invalidated.  The import of this decision is that it was made in the context of a purely economic regulation.  The plurality examines the statute and its resultant harm as an ad hoc factual inquiry based on factors delineated in Penn Central such as the economic impact of the regulation, its interference with reasonable investment backed expectations, and the character of the governmental action. (""Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City""), The decision thereby moved beyond the traditional notions of equal protection which had been applied to economic regulation since the time of (""Lochner v. New York""), requiring extreme deference to Congress, and applied a regulatory takings analysis to the problem resulting in a much less deferential result.  While the plurality recognizes that this is not a traditional takings case where the government appropriates private property for public use, they also state this is the type of case where the ""Armstrong Principle"" of preventing the government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.  (""Armstrong v. United States"", 364 U.S. 40, 49 (1960)) However, while the plurality seems to invalidate this particular law on takings grounds, the concurrences and the dissents warn of such an analysis as this should actually be examined under substantive due process or ex post facto theories."

Though the law, by its language, was generally applicable to all banks not chartered in Maryland, the Second Bank of the United States was the only out-of-state bank then existing in Maryland, and the law was recognized in the court's opinion as having specifically targeted the Bank of the United States.  The Court invoked the Necessary and Proper Clause of the Constitution, which allowed the Federal government to pass laws not expressly provided for in the Constitution's list of express powers, provided those laws are in useful furtherance of the express powers of Congress under the Constitution."

1722,NGC 3190,"NGC 3190 is a spiral galaxy with tightly wound arms and lying in the constellation Leo.  It was discovered by William Herschel in 1784.  NGC 3190 is member of Hickson 44 galaxy group, estimated at around 80 million light years away, and consisting of four galaxies in a tight group - NGC 3193 is fairly featureless, NGC 3187 is a dim but striking spiral galaxy and NGC 3185 has a barred spiral structure with an outer ring."
1723,NGC 4319,"NGC 4319 is a face-on barred spiral galaxy located about 77 million light years away in the constellation Draco.  The morphological classification is SB(r)ab, which indicates it is a barred spiral with an inner ring structure and moderate to tightly wound arms.  It is situated in physical proximity to the galaxies NGC 4291 and NGC 4386, with X-ray emissions from the intervening gap indicating NGC 4319 and NGC 4291 may be interacting.  NGC 4319 has a much higher proportion of ionized hydrogen compared to the Milky Way galaxy."
1724,NGC 7331,"NGC 7331 (also known as Caldwell 30) is a unbarred spiral galaxy about 40 e6ly away in the constellation Pegasus.  It was discovered by William Herschel in 1784.  NGC 7331 is the brightest member of the NGC 7331 Group of galaxies.  The other members of the group are the lenticular or unbarred spirals NGC 7335 and 7336, the barred spiral galaxy NGC 7337 and the elliptical galaxy NGC 7340.  These galaxies lie at distances of approximately 332, 365, 348 and 294 million light years, respectively.  In both visible light and infrared photos of the NGC 7331, the core of the galaxy appears to be slightly off-center, with one side of the disk appearing to extend further away from the core than the opposite side."
1725,NGC 7479,"NGC 7479 (also known as Caldwell 44) is a barred spiral galaxy about 105 million light-years away in the constellation Pegasus.  It was discovered by William Herschel in 1784.  Supernovae SN 1990U and SN2009jf occurred in NGC 7479.  NGC 7479 is also recognized as a Seyfert galaxy and a Liner undergoing starburst activity not only on the nucleus and the outer arms, but also across the bar of the galaxy, where most of the stars were formed in the last 100 million years.  Polarization studies of this galaxy indicate that it recently underwent a minor merger and that it is unique in the radio continuum, with arms opening in a direction opposite to the optical arms.  This feature, along with the asymmetrical arms of the galaxy and the intense star formation activity are attributed to a merger with a smaller galaxy.  This galaxy is similar in both size and morphology to the barred spiral NGC 1300."
1726,NGC 2207 and IC 2163,"NGC 2207 and IC 2163 are a pair of colliding spiral galaxies about 80 million light-years away in the constellation Canis Major.  Both galaxies were discovered by John Herschel in 1835.  The larger spiral, NGC 2207, is classified as an intermediate spiral galaxy exhibiting a weak inner ring structure around the central bar.  The smaller companion spiral, IC 2163, is classified as a barred spiral galaxy that also exhibits a weak inner ring and an elongated spiral arm that is likely being stretched by tidal forces with the larger companion.  Both galaxies contain a vast amount of dust and gas, and are beginning to exhibit enhanced rates of star formation, as seen in infrared images.  So far, four supernovae have been observed in NGC 2207:"
1727,NGC 3344,"NGC 3344 is a relatively isolated barred spiral galaxy located 22.5 million light years away in the constellation Leo Minor.  This galaxy belongs to the group known as the Leo spur, which is a branch of the Virgo Supercluster.  NGC 3344 has the morphological classification (R)SAB(r)bc, which indicates it is a weakly barred spiral galaxy that exhibits rings and moderate to loosely wound spiral arms.  There is both an inner and outer ring, with the prominent arms radiating outward from the inner ring and the slightly elliptical bar being situated inside.  At the center of the bar is an HII nucleus with an angular diameter of about 3″."
1728,NGC 4454,"NGC 4454 is a barred spiral galaxy located about 123 million light-years away in the constellation of Virgo.  NGC 4454 was discovered by astronomer William Herschel on April 17, 1784."
1729,NGC 4444,"NGC 4444 is an intermediate spiral galaxy in the constellation Centaurus.  The morphological classification places it midway on the continuum between a barred spiral (SB) and an unbarred spiral (SA), with an inner region that lies between a ring-like (""r"") and a purely spiral form (""s""), and medium- (""b"") to loosely wound (""c"") outer spiral arms.  This makes it a hybrid ringed, barred spiral galaxy.  It has an angular size of 2.4 × 1.6 arcminutes and the estimated mass ""M"" is given log ""M"" = 9.76, yielding 5.8 billion solar masses."
1730,Intermediate spiral galaxy,"An intermediate spiral galaxy is a galaxy that is in between the classifications of a barred spiral galaxy and an unbarred spiral galaxy.  It is designated as SAB in the galaxy morphological classification scheme.  By definition, a galaxy is a congregation of stars held together by gravity.  The first intermediate spiral galaxy discovered is the Milky Way, by Galileo, in 1610.  He was the first person with a telescope powerful enough to make such a discovery.  Before Galileo, it was thought that all bright objects in the sky were either the planets in the Solar System, moons, comets, or stars.  Until the beginning on the twentieth century, astronomers did not know the size of the Universe, but speculated it to be about as big as the Milky Way.  In 1920, at the National Academy of Science, there was a big debate between Harlow Shapley and Heber D. Curtis on whether nebulae are small globular clusters surrounding the Milky Way, or separate galaxies located farther away.  Nothing was resolved at the debate; neither side was able to provide conclusive evidence to prove their side correct over their opponent.  In 1923, Edwin Hubble resolved the matter with a photograph that he took of the Andromeda Galaxy.  What he found in his photograph was a very bright light source pulsing at a certain rate, a Cepheid variable, located outside the Milky Way.  This can be used to determine the distance to it.  Hubble proved that the Universe was full of galaxies, and disproved that the Milky Way was the extent of the Universe.  There are many types of galaxies in the Universe, elliptical, barred spiral galaxies; they vary in shape and size, but on average spiral galaxies are the most abundant."

It has a tall central tower and featured an ornate interior with marble sculpture and murals.  The church is 184 feet long, 65 feet wide, and the ceiling is 51 feet from the floor.  The steeple, at 256 feet, is the second tallest church tower in the city (next to First and Franklin Street Presbyterian Church at West Madison Street and Park Avenue, in Mount Vernon-Belveere neighborhood, constructed 1875), which dominates Old East Baltimore.  The cross surmounting the spire, is 10 feet tall.  There is a peal of four bells in the tower, the largest weighing 5000 pounds, cast by McShane of Baltimore, in 1885.  The tower clock was installed during the same year.  The magnificent and priceless 25 foot-high Mayer windows were installed in 1891.  The church is an early work of George A. Frederick (1842-1924), a prolific and prominent architect in Baltimore who designed various buildings in the city including the Baltimore City Hall in 1875.  The interior features three large interior murals painted about 1886 by the German-born artist William Lamprecht and marble sculpture work by the Baltimore sculptor Joseph Martin Sudsburg.  In 1966, the neighbouring parish of St. John the Evangelist was closed, and the new parish of St. James and St. John, was formed, the congregation worshipping at St. James.  The parish was dissolved around 1986, and the former St. James Church was sold to an evangelical church.  Most regrettably, the church has been stripped of its windows, altars, marble communion rail, pipe organ, and other artifacts, and the church has been whitewashed, destroying its beautiful and historic murals."

For instrument lessons, teachers show students how to sit or stand with the instrument, how to hold the instrument, and how to manipulate the fingers and other body parts to produce tones and sounds from the instrument.  Music teachers also assign technical exercises, musical pieces, and other activities to help the students improve their musical skills.  While most music lessons are one-on-one (private), some teachers also teach groups of two to four students (semi-private lessons), and, for very basic instruction, some instruments are taught in large group lessons, such as piano and acoustic guitar.

1755,Mass media in Canada,"The term mass media refers to any means or technology used to communicate a message to large groups of people.  Popular forms of mass media include television, the Internet, and newspapers.  Mass media are specifically intended to reach larger audiences.  The term is often divided into two broad categories: that of electronic mass media and that of print mass media.  Electronic mass media require their audiences to interact with electronics in order to receive the message.  They attempt to recreate or represent a message through moving pictures and/or sound.  Four common examples of electronic media used in Canadian society are television, radio, films, and the Internet.  Print mass media, on the other hand, refers to any media that is distributed to audiences in a printed form, on paper.  Examples of this include newspapers, printed books, and magazines.  The mass media model in Canada is different from the mass media model of the United States as well as the rest of the world.  According to John A. Irving, mass media functions differently in Canadian society because of a lack of collective identity; this is in reference to Canada's languages (and related cultures) as well as its proximity to the United States.  Irving states that such cultural dualism means that only some of the population responds to the mass media in English, while the other portion remain uninfluenced by English-based media.  In terms of the proximity to the United States, he explains that ""most of the difficulties that threaten the mass media in Canada are the direct outcome of American economic and cultural imperialism.""  Because of the United States' overwhelming influence on Canadian mass media, Canada has not been able to form its own identity in the media.  These two factors have slowed down the process of the creation of a Canadian community.  Mass media help in forming a community through communication.  When a large group of people is in communication with one another through media, an identifiable culture is formed.  Individuals in dialectic experience a sense of membership and collective identity."

1969,Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources,"Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources is a strategy wherein samples of animal genetic materials are preserved cryogenically.  Animal genetic resources, as defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, are ""those animal species that are used, or may be used, for the production of food and agriculture, and the populations within each of them.  These populations within each species can be classified as wild and feral populations, landraces and primary populations, standardised breeds, selected lines, varieties, strains and any conserved genetic material; all of which are currently categorized as Breeds.""  Genetic materials that are typically cryogenically preserved include sperm, oocytes, embryos and somatic cells.  Cryogenic facilities are called gene banks and can vary greatly in size usually according to the economic resources available.  They must be able to facilitate germplasm collection, processing, freezing, and long term storage, all in a hygienic and organized manner.  Gene banks must maintain a precise database and make information and genetic resources accessible to properly facilitate cryoconservation.  Cryoconservation is an ""ex situ"" conservation strategy that often coexists alongside ""in situ"" conservation to protect and preserve livestock genetics.  Cryoconservation of livestock genetic resources is primarily done in order to preserve the genetics of populations of interest, such as indigenous breeds, also known as local or minor breeds.  Material may be stored because individuals shared specific genes and phenotypes that may be of value or have potential value for researchers or breeders.  Therefore, one of the main goals remains preserving the gene pool of local breeds that may be threatened.  Indigenous livestock genetics are commonly threatened by factors such as globalization, modernization, changes in production systems, inappropriate introduction of major breeds, genetic drift, inbreeding, crossbreeding, climate change, natural disasters, disease, cultural changes, and urbanization.  Indigenous livestock are critical to sustainable agricultural development and food security, due to their: adaptation to environment and endemic diseases, indispensable part in local production systems, social and cultural significance, and importance to local rural economies.  The genetic resources of minor breeds have value to the local farmers, consumers of the products, private companies and investors interested in crossbreeding, breed associations, governments, those conducting research and development, and non-governmental organizations.  Therefore, efforts have been made by national governments and non-governmental organizations, such as the Livestock Conservancy, to encourage conservation of livestock genetics through cryoconservation, as well as through other ""ex situ"" and ""in situ"" strategies.  Cryogenic specimens of livestock genetic resources can be preserved and used for extended periods of time.  This advantage makes cryoconservation beneficial particularly for threatened breeds who have low breed populations.  Cryogenically preserved specimens can be used to revive breeds that are endangered or extinct, for breed improvement, crossbreeding, research and development.  However, cryoconservation can be an expensive strategy and requires long term hygienic and economic commitment for germplasms to remain viable.  Cryoconservation can also face unique challenges based on the species, as some species have a reduced survival rate of frozen germplasm."
1970,Koolie,"The Koolie (also known as the Australian Koolie or by the misnomer German Coolie) is an Australian dog breed.  The Koolie is a working or herding dog which has existed in Australia since the early 19th century when it was bred from imported British working dogs.  Robert Kaleski, in an article on Cattle Dogs in the August 1903 issue of the Agricultural Gazette of New South Wales, describes the ""Welsh heeler or merle, erroneously known as the German collie,"" as a ""blue-gray dog about the size and build of a smooth-haired collie, generally with wall eyes.""

It is most commonly seen in intact (not neutered) dogs and is the third most common tumor type in intact male dogs.  There are two types of perianal gland tumors, perianal gland adenomas, which are benign, and perianal gland adenocarcinomas, which are malignant.  Both have receptors for testosterone.  Perianal gland adenomas are three times more likely to be found in intact male dogs than females, and perianal gland adenocarcinomas are ten times more common in male dogs than females.  The most commonly affected breeds for adenomas are the Siberian Husky, Cocker Spaniel, Pekingese, and Samoyed; for adenocarcinomas the most commonly affected breeds are the Siberian Husky, Bulldog, and Alaskan Malamute."

1976,List of goat breeds,"This is a list of goat breeds.  There are many recognized breeds of domestic goat ""(Capra aegagrus hircus)"".  Goat breeds (especially dairy goats) are some of the oldest defined animal breeds for which breed standards and production records have been kept.  Selective breeding of goats generally focuses on improving production of fiber, meat, dairy products or goatskin.  Breeds are generally classified based on their primary use, though there are several breeds which are considered dual- or multi-purpose goats, so there is some crossover between lists."

2170,Trusham,"Trusham is a small village in the Teign Valley just outside Chudleigh between Newton Abbot and Exeter in Devon.  The name originates from the Celtic 'Trisma', considered by Ekwall to mean ‘brushwood’ or ‘fallen leaves’, became 'Trisme' for about four hundred years, and then in the 16th century 'Tryssame' or 'Trysham'.  It has one pub - the Cridford Inn - probably the oldest pub/inn in Devon and possibly the oldest in England.  It was quoted in ""The Which Guide to Country Pubs"" dated March 1988 that the main site of the now, Cridford Inn, dates back to 825AD - well before Alfred the Great and was originally inhabited by the early Britons/Celts.  However, King Athelstan of the English notably expelled ""that filthy race"" (the Britons) from Exeter and the surrounding area, as far as Cornwall, in 927AD.  The building was presumably remodelled in 1081, as a small cobbled area in which was set a crude mosaic, made of dolerite and quartz, bearing the initials HJ and the year 1081 was discovered during renovations in 1988.  This mosaic is thankfully preserved and displayed under glass in the inn's restaurant.  The Cridford had also previously served as a nunnery and a farm.  In 1086 it is understood to be one of the nine small-holdings mentioned in the “Domesday Book”, and by then belonged to the Abbey of Buckfast in the Manor of Trusham.  During the early 13th to 15th Centuries, the building itself was a farmhouse and the stained glass mullion window in the bar is from this period and is possibly the earliest surviving example of a Medieval domestic window in England.  It is also believed that The Cridford Inn is home to two ghosts,; one is said to be a Nun from the very early history of the property and a second is a Cavalier from Trusham's conflict with Ashton, (a nearby village) during the Civil war of 1642-46.  In more recent times, the buildings reverted to farm use and as a Devon Longhouse was previously known as Cridford Farm, the home of one branch of the Cridford family who have a long history in Devon.  Members of the Cridford family still live in Devon."
2171,Hen Ogledd,"Yr Hen Ogledd (] ), in English the Old North, is the region of Northern England and the southern Scottish Lowlands inhabited by the Celtic Britons of sub-Roman Britain and the Early Middle Ages.  Its denizens spoke a variety of the Brittonic language known as Cumbric.  The Hen Ogledd was distinct from the parts of northern Britain inhabited by the Picts, Anglo-Saxons, and Scoti as well as from Wales, although the people of the Hen Ogledd were the same Brittonic stock as the Picts, Welsh and Cornish, and the region loomed large in Welsh literature and tradition for centuries after its kingdoms had disappeared."
2172,Caledonians,"The Caledonians (Latin: ""Caledones"" or ""Caledonii ""; Greek: Καληδώνες , ""Kalēdōnes"") or the Caledonian Confederacy were a group of indigenous peoples of what is now Scotland during the Iron Age and Roman eras.  The name is an exonym: the Ancient Greeks and Romans knew their territory as Caledonia and used the term vaguely in reference to its inhabitants.  The Caledonians were initially considered to be a group of Britons, but were later distinguished as the Picts, a related people who nonetheless spoke a Brittonic language.  The Caledonian Britons were enemies of the Roman Empire, which was the occupying force then administering most of Great Britain as the Roman province of ""Britannia""."
2173,Battle of Coilsfield,"The Battle of Coilsfield was a semi-legendary clash in Ayrshire, Scotland, between an allied force of Picts and Scots under Fergus I and an army of Britons led by Coilus, the Coel Hen of the Welsh genealogies.  The Britons had invaded Ayrshire and established a substantial camp on or near the banks of the River Doon, south of the town of Ayr.  Place-names such as ""Cynning Park"", ""North Park"", ""Gear Holm"", ""Wrights Field"", ""Slap-house"" Burn, and most telling, ""Cambusdoon"", provide clues to the extent of the encampment and the numbers of men involved.  Fergus allowed the Britons to languish in their camp well into winter, so as to exhaust their supplies and whittle down their numbers through disease and desertion.  Taking advantage of a drunken Yule-tide revelry in the camp, the Picts and Scots attacked at night during the third watch.  The camp, which had no ramparts or palisade, was successfully overrun.  The army of Coilus fled the Doon-side camp in complete panic.  After a circuitous retreat south around the ""Craigs of Kyle"", Fergus cornered the remnants west of the hamlet of Failford, and slaughtered Coilus and his men at the place now called Coilsfield.  The few survivors rallied around the remnants of the baggage train, and after a brief truce, Fergus wisely allowed them to depart.  Place-names in this area include ""Dead-mens Holm"", ""The Bloody Burn"", ""Fergus-lea"", ""Cairn-gillan Hill"", ""Shackle Hill"", and ""King Coil's Grave"", a Bronze-age burial mound."
2174,Picts,"The Picts were a tribal confederation of peoples who lived in what is today eastern and northern Scotland during the Late Iron Age and Early Medieval periods.  They are thought to have been ethnolinguistically Celtic.  Where they lived and what their culture was like can be inferred from the geographical distribution of brochs, Brittonic place name elements, and Pictish stones.  Picts are attested to in written records from before the Roman conquest of Britain to the 10th century, when they are thought to have merged with the Gaels.  They lived to the north of the rivers Forth and Clyde, and spoke the now-extinct Pictish language, which is thought to have been closely related to the Celtic Brittonic language spoken by the Britons who lived to the south of them."
2175,Britannia,"Britannia was a Roman-Britain province inhabited by the Celtic Britons, Belgae and Picts, encompassing parts of the island south of Caledonia (roughly Scotland) of the geographical region of Great Britain and is the name given to the female personification of the island.  It is a term still used to refer to the island.  The name is Latin, and derives from the Greek form ""Prettanike"" or ""Brettaniai"", which originally designated a collection of islands with individual names, including ""Albion"" or Great Britain.  By the 1st century BC, ""Britannia"" came to be used for Great Britain specifically.  The Romans had initially called the entire provincial island ""Britain"" and it was only when the island was split into four provinces that two were given the name ""Britannia"".  Although Britain had been designated part of the Roman Empire in 43 AD during the conquest of emperor Claudius it wasn't until the end of the 2nd century that Britannia had been pacified and fully adopted Roman practices."
2176,Hadrian's Wall,"Hadrian's Wall (Latin: ""Vallum Aelium"" ), also called the Roman Wall, Picts' Wall, or ""Vallum Hadriani"" in Latin, was a defensive fortification in the Roman province of Britannia, begun in AD 122 in the reign of the emperor Hadrian.  It ran from the banks of the River Tyne near the North Sea to the Solway Firth on the Irish Sea, and was the northern limit of the Roman Empire, immediately north of which were the lands of the northern Ancient Britons, including the Picts."
2177,Portus Adurni,"Portus Adurni was a Roman fortress in the Roman province of Britannia situated at the north end of Portsmouth Harbour.  Listed in the Notitia Dignitatum, it is generally accepted as having been located at grid reference [ SU624045] adjoining Portchester in the English county of Hampshire and was later converted into a medieval castle known as Portchester Castle.  It is the best preserved Roman fort north of the Alps."
2178,Teggiano,"Teggiano (formerly called Diano) is a town and ""comune"" in Campania, Italy, in the province of Salerno.  It is situated on an isolated eminence above the upper part of the valley to which it gives the name of Vallo di Diano. Among the historic centers of the Province of Salerno, Teggiano is certainly one that has best preserved its ancient appearance of the fortress and it is this aspect which is shown to those who reach the old town.  The natural appearance of Roman Oppidum, still now remembered by the well preserved plan of the Cardo and of the Decumanus, was renewed in the Norman period and in the age of Frederick II of Hohenstaufen."
2179,Children of Llullaillaco,"The Children of Llullaillaco (] , ), also known as the Mummies of Llullaillaco, are three Inca child mummies rediscovered on 16 March 1999 by Dr. Johan Reinhard and his archaeological team near the summit of Llullaillaco, a 6739 m stratovolcano in the Andes mountains on the border between Chile and Argentina.  The children were sacrifices in an Inca religious ritual that is believed to have taken place  1500 .  In this ritual, the three children were drugged and allowed to freeze on top of the mountain, and then they were placed inside a small chamber 1.5 m beneath the ground, where they were left to die.  According to Dr. Reinhard, the mummies ""appear to be the best preserved Inca mummies ever found"", and other archaeologists have expressed the same opinion, calling them among the best preserved mummies in the world."
2180,Nick Faure,"Nick Faure (born 28 May 1944) is a former English Sportscar racing driver, and purveyor of Porsche in the United Kingdom of his era.  Known affectionately as ""Mr. Porsche"", Faure achieved fame through racing and selling Porsche 911 and 356s, since the 1960s and his name has become synonymous with the marque.

With an ongoing arms buildup against the Soviet Union, President Ronald Reagan and his Administration had a great deal of concern for the U.S. nuclear war plan and what may occur if we did not take action.  After being briefed on the strike plan in place, President Reagan was unsatisfied and took measures to simulate a response to the onset of a nuclear war.  The simulation consisted of 200 Military Personnel and Politicians with only twelve days of actual play.  Stretching the twelve days of gameplay over several week periods, Personnel involved in the simulation were forced to make critical strategic and diplomatic decisions to test the effectiveness of the United States strike plan.  Due to heightened tensions with the ongoing Cold War made this simulation the most realistic in United States Military history.  For the first time ever, the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff took part in the game, although their participation was concealed.  One of the main purposes of the simulation was to test the response of the National Command Authority's (NCA) decision making when dealing with many different situations at once.  Although Proud Prophet was intended to help senior officials test their nuclear strategies, it was apparent that many of the concepts in place were incompatible with current Military capabilities.  Many important parts of this simulation saw limited use of de-escalation tactics.  If a risk of a war did occur, many Military advisors saw the use of nuclear missiles as the deterring factor when dealing with the Soviet Union.  The idea behind this concept was that Soviet forces would seek ceasefire if the West moved to use nuclear weapons.  The final outcome of the Proud Prophet war game would show the need to resolve global issues in times of war or potential war.  The outcome of an all-out nuclear war is the total destruction of both sides involved, and a death toll nearly reaching half a billion with the remaining dying from starvation or lethal doses of radiation.  The government file for Proud Prophet was not declassified until December 20th, 2012, and was only declassified in part.  While there is no known reason why it was unclassified under the Obama administration."

It is often used as a hiking, hunting, and off-roading area for dirt bikers, quadders, paintballers, and four-wheelers that includes miles of trails with near beach sand consistency.  Spinney hills gets its name because of Spinney Road, which used to connect the East Quogue side of the hills to Sears Bellows County Park and Flanders (home of the Big Duck) to the north prior to the construction of the Sunrise Highway New York State Route 27.  This region was created by glacial deposits of rock and sand during the last ice age.  The sandy soil also absorbs most rainfall so there are few ponds or rivers in the area.  There is a shallow glacial well in Spinney Hills known as an aquifer, which is where most of the rainfall in the region is stored.  These hills are the continuation of a long east west ridge of hills known as the Ronkonkoma Moraine, which form the 'backbone' of Long Island.  Much of this region is undeveloped other than a sand mine to the west and Southampton Pines to the east.  There have been large scale legal battles between private real estate companies and the Town of Southampton over the future of the area, being it is one of the last expanses of wilderness left on Long Island.

2608,Internal category,"In mathematics, more specifically in category theory - internal categories are a generalisation of the notion of small category, and are defined with respect to a fixed ambient category.  If the ambient category is taken to be the category of sets then one recovers the theory of small categories.  In general, internal categories consist of a pair of objects in the ambient category - thought of as the 'object of objects' and 'object of morphisms', together with a collection of morphisms in the ambient category satisfying certain identities.  Group objects, are common examples of internal categories."

2610,Category utility,"Category utility is a measure of ""category goodness"" defined in and .  It attempts to maximize both the probability that two objects in the same category have attribute values in common, and the probability that objects from different categories have different attribute values.  It was intended to supersede more limited measures of category goodness such as ""cue validity"" (; ) and ""collocation index"" .  It provides a normative information-theoretic measure of the ""predictive advantage"" gained by the observer who possesses knowledge of the given category structure (i.e., the class labels of instances) over the observer who does ""not"" possess knowledge of the category structure.  In this sense the motivation for the ""category utility"" measure is similar to the information gain metric used in decision tree learning.  In certain presentations, it is also formally equivalent to the mutual information, as discussed below.  A review of ""category utility"" in its probabilistic incarnation, with applications to machine learning, is provided in ."
2611,Dagger symmetric monoidal category,"A dagger symmetric monoidal category is a monoidal category formula_1 which also possesses a dagger structure; in other words, it means that this category comes equipped not only with a tensor in the category theoretic sense but also with dagger structure which is used to describe unitary morphism and self-adjoint morphisms in formula_2 that is, a form of abstract analogues of those found in FdHilb, the category of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.  This type of category was introduced by Selinger as an intermediate structure between dagger categories and the dagger compact categories that are used in categorical quantum mechanics, an area which now also considers dagger symmetric monoidal categories when dealing with infinite-dimensional quantum mechanical concepts."
2612,Yoneda lemma,"In mathematics, specifically in category theory, the Yoneda lemma is an abstract result on functors of the type ""morphisms into a fixed object"".  It is a vast generalisation of Cayley's theorem from group theory (viewing a group as a particular kind of category with just one object).  It allows the embedding of any category into a category of functors (contravariant set-valued functors) defined on that category.  It also clarifies how the embedded category, of representable functors and their natural transformations, relates to the other objects in the larger functor category.  It is an important tool that underlies several modern developments in algebraic geometry and representation theory.  It is named after Nobuo Yoneda."

There three categories (from hardest to easiest) A, B, and C, also called Dance.  In each categories there are group and individual routines.  In C Category (here group routines are also called Dance Show) team member can go from 4 to 8.  In A and B category there are duos, small groups (3-4), and big groups (5-6).  In C category, individually 4 elements have to be performed ( one from each type), A or B difficulty, and in groups, two are optional.  In B category individually 8 elements need to be performed ( two from each type) A-D difficulty ( but max.  two elements can be D), and in groups 4 (same as C category individual).

2628,Orthodox cross,"The Orthodox, Byzantine or Russian (Orthodox) cross, also known as the Suppedaneum cross, is a variation of the Christian cross, could be found in every Eastern Orthodox Church, as well as the Eastern Catholic Churches of the Byzantine Rite, and used widely by groups to connote the Byzantine Rite.  The cross has three horizontal crossbeams—the top one represents the plate which in the older Greek tradition is inscribed with a phrase based on John's Gospel ""The King of Glory"", but in later images it represents , and the bottom one, a footrest.  In many depictions, the side to Christ's right is higher.  This is because the footrest slants upward toward the penitent thief St. Dismas, who was (according to tradition) crucified on Jesus' right, and downward toward impenitent thief Gestas.  It is also a common perception that the foot-rest points up, toward Heaven, on Christ’s right hand-side, and downward, to Hades, on Christ’s left.  One of the Orthodox Church’s Friday prayers clearly explains the meaning: ""In the midst, between two thieves, was Your Cross found as the balance-beam of righteousness; For while one was led down to hell by the burden of his blaspheming, the other was lightened of his sins unto the knowledge of things divine, O Christ God glory to You.""  Though commonly associated with the Russian Orthodox Church, this version is found also in the Greek and Serbian Orthodox churches, although other varieties are also common, including those with a straight footstool and one slanted in the opposite direction.  Common variations include the ""Cross over Crescent"" and the ""Calvary cross"".  The Byzantine cross is also the name for a Latin cross with outwardly spreading ends.  It was the most common cruciform in the Byzantine Empire.  Other crosses (patriarchal cross, Russian Orthodox cross, etc.) are sometimes misunderstood as ""Byzantine cross"" when they are from the Byzantine culture."

2837,Music of the United Kingdom (1970s),"Popular music of the United Kingdom in the 1970s built upon the new forms of music developed from blues rock towards the end of the 1960s, including folk rock and psychedelic rock.  Several important and influential subgenres were created in Britain in this period, by pursuing the limitations of rock music, including British folk rock and glam rock, a process that reached its apogee in the development of progressive rock and one of the most enduring subgenres in heavy metal music.  Britain also began to be increasingly influenced by aspects of World music, including Jamaican and Indian music, resulting in new music scenes and subgenres.  In the middle years of the decade the influence of the pub rock and American punk rock movements led to the British intensification of punk, which swept away much of the existing landscape of popular music, replacing it with much more diverse new wave and post punk bands who mixed different forms of music and influences to dominate rock and pop music into the 1980s."
2838,List of rock genres,"This is a list of rock music genres consisting of subgenres of popular music that have roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, and which developed into a distinct identity as rock music in the 1960s, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States.  By the late 1960s, a number of identifiable rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, and jazz-rock fusion, many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock influenced by the counter-cultural psychedelic scene.  New genres that emerged from this scene included progressive rock, which extended the artistic elements; glam rock, which highlighted showmanship and visual style; and the diverse and enduring major subgenre of heavy metal, which emphasized volume, power, and speed.  In the second half of the 1970s, punk rock both intensified and reacted against some of these trends to produce a raw, energetic form of music characterized by overt political and social critiques.  Punk was an influence into the 1980s on the subsequent development of other subgenres, including new wave, post-punk and eventually the alternative rock movement.  From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break through into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock.  Further fusion subgenres have since emerged as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock's history."
2839,British folk rock,"British folk rock (sometimes called electric folk) is a form of folk rock developed in the United Kingdom from the mid 1960s, and was at its most significant in the 1970s.  Though the merging of folk and rock music came from several sources, it is widely regarded that the success of ""The House of the Rising Sun"" by British band the Animals in 1964 was a catalyst, prompting Bob Dylan to ""go electric"", in which, like the Animals, he brought folk and rock music together, from which other musicians followed.  In the same year, the Beatles began incorporating overt folk influences into their music, most noticeably on the song ""I'm a Loser"" from their ""Beatles for Sale"" album.  The Beatles and other British Invasion bands, in turn, influenced the Californian band the Byrds, who released their recording of Dylan's ""Mr Tambourine Man"" in April 1965, setting off the mid-1960s folk rock movement.  A number of British groups, usually those associated with the British folk revival, moved into folk rock in the mid-1960s, including the Strawbs, Pentangle, Eclection, and Fairport Convention."
2840,Folk music of England,"The folk music of England is traditionally based music, which has existed since the later medieval period.  It is often contrasted with courtly, classical and later commercial music.  Folk music has been preserved and transmitted orally, through print and later through recordings.  The term is used to refer to English traditional music and music composed, or delivered, in a traditional style.  English folk music has produced or contributed to several important musical genres, including sea shanties, jigs, hornpipes and dance music, such as that used for Morris dancing.  It can be seen as having distinct regional and local variations in content and style, particularly in areas more removed from the cultural and political centres of the English state, as in Northumbria, or the West Country.  Cultural interchange and processes of migration mean that English folk music, although in many ways distinctive, has particularly interacted with the music of Scotland.  It has also interacted with other musical traditions, particularly classical and rock music, influencing musical styles and producing musical fusions, such as British folk rock, folk punk and folk metal.  There remains a flourishing sub-culture of English folk music, which continues to influence other genres and occasionally to gain mainstream attention."
2841,Indigo Girls,"Indigo Girls are a Grammy Award-winning folk rock music American duo consisting of Amy Ray and Emily Saliers.  They met in elementary school and began performing together as high school students in Decatur, Georgia, part of the Atlanta metropolitan area.

2842,British popular music,"British popular music and popular music in general, can be defined in a number of ways, but is used here to describe music which is not part of the art/classical music or Church music traditions, including folk music, jazz, pop and rock music.  These forms of music have particularly flourished in Britain, which, it has been argued, has influenced popular music disproportionately to its size, partly due to its linguistic and cultural links with many countries, particularly the former areas of British control such as United States, Canada, and Australia, but also a capacity for invention, innovation and fusion, which has led to the development of, or participation in, many of the major trends in popular music.  This is particularly true since the early 1960s when the British Invasion led by The Beatles, helped to secure British performers a major place in development of pop and rock music, which has been revisited at various times, with genres originating in or being radically developed by British musicians, including: blues rock, heavy metal music, progressive rock, punk rock, British folk rock, folk punk, acid jazz, drum and bass, grime, dubstep and Britpop."
2843,Sara Lee (musician),"Sara Lee is an English bassist and singer-songwriter, who came to prominence replacing Dave Allen on bass guitar in post-punk band Gang of Four.  She is also notable for work with Robert Fripp, B-52s, Ani DiFranco and Indigo Girls."
2844,Folk rock,"Folk rock is a music genre combining elements of folk music and rock music.  In its earliest and narrowest sense, the term referred to a genre that arose in the United States and the United Kingdom around the mid-1960s.  The genre emerged from bands such as the Beatles, the Searchers, and the Animals in the UK, and Bob Dylan and the Byrds in the US, who played traditional folk music and songs with rock instrumentation.  The term ""folk rock"" is first noted as being used by the U.S. music press in June 1965 to describe the Byrds' music; the band's debut album was released the same month."
2845,Medieval folk rock,"Medieval folk rock, medieval rock or medieval folk is a musical subgenre that emerged in the early 1970s in England and Germany which combined elements of early music with rock music.  It grew out of the British folk rock and progressive folk movements of the later 1960s.  Despite the name, the term was used indiscriminately to categorise performers who incorporated elements of medieval, renaissance and baroque music into their work and sometimes to describe groups who used few, or no, electric instruments.  This subgenre reached its height towards the middle of the 1970s when it achieved some mainstream success in Britain, but within a few years most groups had either disbanded, or were absorbed into the wider movements of progressive folk and progressive rock.  Nevertheless, the genre had a considerable impact within progressive rock where early music and medievalism in general, was a major influence and through that in the development of heavy metal.  More recently medieval folk rock has revived in popularity along with other forms of medieval inspired music such as Dark Wave orientated neo-Medieval music and medieval metal."
2846,Fairport Convention,"Fairport Convention are a British folk rock band.  Formed in 1967, they are widely regarded as a key group in the English folk rock movement.  Their seminal album ""Liege & Lief"" is considered to have launched the British folk rock movement, which provided a distinctively English identity to rock music and helped awaken much wider interest in traditional music in general.  The large number of personnel who have been part of the band are among the most highly regarded and influential musicians of their era and have gone on to participate in a large number of significant bands, or enjoyed important solo careers."

Taney succeeded John Marshall as Chief Justice after Marshall's death in 1835.  Taney served as Chief Justice until his death in 1864, at which point Salmon P. Chase took office.  Taney had been an important member of Andrew Jackson's administration, an advocate of Jacksonian democracy, and had played a major role in the Bank War, during which Taney wrote a memo questioning the Supreme Court's power of judicial review.  However, the Taney Court did not strongly break from the decisions and precedents of the Marshall Court, as it continued to uphold a strong federal government with an independent judiciary.  Most of the Taney Court's holdings are overshadowed by the ""Dred Scott"" decision, in which the court ruled that African-Americans could not be citizens. However, the Taney Court's decisions regarding economic issues and separation of powers set important precedents, and the Taney Court has been lauded for its ability to adapt regulatory law to a country undergoing remarkable technological and economic progress."
2888,Robert Cooper Grier,"Robert Cooper Grier (March 5, 1794 – September 25, 1870), was an American jurist who served on the Supreme Court of the United States.  A Jacksonian Democrat from Pennsylvania who served from 1846 to 1870, Grier weighed in on some of the most important cases of the 19th century.  As a rare Northern member of the majority in the infamous 1857 Dred Scott decision, Grier concurred that African Americans were not—and were never meant to be—citizens of the United States and that the property rights of slaveholders were clearly protected in the Constitution.  However, Grier wrote the majority opinion in the 1863 Prize Cases, upholding Abraham Lincoln’s presidential power to institute Union blockades of Confederate ports and giving the Union Army a strategic advantage in the American Civil War."
2889,Dred Scott v. Sandford,"Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. 393 (1857) , also known simply as the Dred Scott case, was a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court on US labor law and constitutional law.  It held that ""a negro, whose ancestors were imported into [the U.S.], and sold as slaves"", whether enslaved or free, could not be an American citizen and therefore had no standing to sue in federal court, and that the federal government had no power to regulate slavery in the federal territories acquired after the creation of the United States.  Dred Scott, an enslaved man of ""the negro African race"" who had been taken by his owners to free states and territories, attempted to sue for his freedom.  In a 7–2 decision written by Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, the court denied Scott's request.  The decision was only the second time that the Supreme Court had ruled an Act of Congress to be unconstitutional."
2890,Jay Court,"The Jay Court refers to the Supreme Court of the United States from 1789 to 1795, when John Jay served as the first Chief Justice of the United States.  Jay served as Chief Justice until his resignation, at which point John Rutledge took office as a recess appointment.  The Supreme Court was established in Article III of the United States Constitution, but the workings of the federal court system were largely laid out by the Judiciary Act of 1789, which set the size of the Supreme Court at six seats.  The court had its first public session in February 1790, but did not decide its first case until 1791.  The court met first in New York City, but moved with the rest of the federal government to Philadelphia in 1791.  In addition to their duties as a court, each justice spent much of his time riding circuit outside of the capital.  The court decided relatively few cases, and perhaps the most important legacy of the court was its refusal to issue an advisory opinion sought by President George Washington, establishing a precedent that the court only hears cases and controversies.  The relative unimportance of the Supreme Court at this time is perhaps best exemplified by the fact that Jay, the sitting Chief Justice, traveled to the United Kingdom in 1794 to negotiate the Jay Treaty for the Washington Administration."
2891,Judiciary of the Bahamas,"The basis of the Bahamian Law and legal system lies within the English Common Law tradition.

Justices of Appeal can serve until the age of 68 years and, where agreed among the judge, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, may serve until the age of 70 years.

Jackalow, a mariner from the Ryukyu Islands, was suspected of the robbery and murder of the captain of the sloop ""Spray"", Jonathan Leete, and Jonathan's brother Elijah, while the ship was at sea.

2896,Rehnquist Court,"The Rehnquist Court refers to the Supreme Court of the United States from 1986 to 2005, when William Rehnquist served as Chief Justice of the United States.  Rehnquist succeeded Warren Burger as Chief Justice after the latter's retirement, and Rehnquist served as Chief Justice until his death in 2005, at which point John Roberts was nominated and confirmed as Rehnquist's replacement.  The Rehnquist Court is generally considered to be more conservative than the preceding Burger Court and Warren Court.  According to Jeffrey Rosen, Rehnquist combined an amiable nature with great organizational skill, and he ""led a Court that put the brakes on some of the excesses of the Earl Warren era while keeping pace with the sentiments of a majority of the country.""  Biographer John Jenkins argued that Rehnquist politicized the Supreme Court and moved the court and the country to the right.  Through its rulings, the Rehnquist Court often promoted a policy of New Federalism in which more power was given to the states at the expense of the federal government.  The Rehnquist Court was also notable for its stability, as the same nine justices served together from 1994 to 2005, the longest such stretch in Supreme Court history."

Defensive emplacements such as anti-tank obstacles, barbed wire and minefields are often used to funnel the enemy into these killing fields.  The fields are generally cleared of most cover so that attackers are exposed when being fired upon.  Some methods of destroying the assault capabilities of attacking forces include machine guns, artillery and mortars; often with interlocking fields of fire.

3269,Prince Hal,"Prince Hal is the standard term used in literary criticism to refer to Shakespeare's portrayal of the young Henry V of England as a prince before his accession to the throne, taken from the diminutive form of his name used in the plays almost exclusively by Falstaff.  Henry is called ""Prince Hal"" in critical commentary on his character in ""Henry IV, Part 1"" and ""Henry IV, Part 2""."
3270,Thomas Erpingham,"Sir Thomas Erpingham KG (  1355 –1428) was an English knight who became famous as the commander of King Henry V's longbow wielding archers at the Battle of Agincourt.  He was immortalised as a character in the play ""Henry V"" by William Shakespeare.  It is, however, his lengthy and loyal service to John of Gaunt, Henry IV and Henry V, which contributed significantly to the establishment of the House of Lancaster upon the English throne, that is his true legacy."

3272,Hundred Years' War (1415–53),"The Lancastrian War was the third phase of the Anglo-French Hundred Years' War.  It lasted from 1415, when Henry V of England invaded Normandy, to 1453 when the English lost Bordeaux.  It followed a long period of peace from the end of the Caroline War in 1389.  The phase was named after the House of Lancaster, the ruling house of the Kingdom of England, to which Henry V belonged.  After the invasion of 1419, Henry V and, after his death, his brother John of Lancaster, Duke of Bedford, brought the English to the height of their power in France, with an English king crowned in Paris.  However, by that time, with charismatic leaders such as Joan of Arc and La Hire, and with England losing its main allies, strong French counterattacks had started to win back all English continental territories, except the Pale of Calais (which was only captured in 1558).  Charles VII of France was crowned in Notre-Dame de Reims in 1429.  The Battle of Castillon (1453) was the last battle of the Hundred Years' War, but France and England remained formally at war until the Treaty of Picquigny in 1475.  English, and later British, monarchs would continue to nominally claim the French throne until 1801, though they would never again seriously pursue it."
3273,Shakespearean history,"In the First Folio, the plays of William Shakespeare were grouped into three categories: comedies, histories, and tragedies.  The histories—along with those of contemporary Renaissance playwrights—help define the genre of history plays.  The histories might be more accurately called the ""English history plays"" and include the outliers ""King John"" and ""Henry VIII"" as well as a continuous sequence of eight plays covering the Wars of the Roses.  These last are considered to have been composed in two cycles.  The so-called first tetralogy, apparently written in the early 1590s, deals with the later part of the struggle and includes ""Henry VI, parts one"", ""two"" & ""three"" and ""Richard III"".  The second tetralogy, finished in 1599 and including ""Richard II"", ""Henry IV, Part 1"", ""Henry IV, Part 2"" and ""Henry V"", is frequently called the ""Henriad"" after its protagonist Prince Hal, the future Henry V."
3274,Dual monarchy of England and France,"The dual monarchy of England and France existed during the latter phase of the Hundred Years' War when Charles VII of France and Henry VI of England disputed the succession to the throne of France.  It commenced on 21 October 1422 upon the death of King Charles VI of France, who had signed the Treaty of Troyes which gave the French crown to his son-in-law Henry V of England and Henry's heirs.  It excluded King Charles's son, the Dauphin Charles, who by right of primogeniture was the heir to the Kingdom of France.  Although the Treaty was ratified by the Estates-General of France, the act was a contravention of the French law of succession which decreed that the French crown could not be alienated.  Henry VI, son of Henry V, became king of both England and France and was recognized only by the English and Burgundians until 1435 as King Henry II of France.  He was crowned King of France on 16 December 1431."
3275,Suite from Henry V,"Suite from Henry V is a 1963 orchestral arrangement of William Walton's musical score from the 1944 film ""Henry V"".  The suite, arranged by Muir Mathieson, is in five movements, although the second and fourth movements had already appeared in string arrangement form in Walton's own Two Pieces for Strings from Henry V."
3276,Henriad,"Henriad is a common title used by scholars for Shakespeare's second historical tetralogy, comprising ""Richard II""; ""Henry IV, Part 1""; ""Henry IV, Part 2""; and ""Henry V"".  The plays depict the destabilising effects of the violation of political continuity with the overthrow of Richard II of England followed by the growth of Henry V of England from a wild youth to a great war leader in ""Henry V"".  Although it was the second tetralogy to be written and performed, the subject matter comes chronologically before the first tetralogy comprising the three ""Henry VI"" plays and ""Richard III"".  The term ""Henriad"" derives from the Classical epics the ""Iliad"" and ""Aeneid""."
3277,Falstaff,"Sir John Falstaff is a fictional character who is mentioned in five plays by William Shakespeare and appears on stage in three of them.  His significance as a fully developed character in Shakespeare is primarily formed in the plays ""Henry IV, Part 1"" and ""Part 2"", where he is a companion to Prince Hal, the future King Henry V.  A notable eulogy for Falstaff is presented in Act II, Scene III of ""Henry V"", where Falstaff does not appear as a character on stage, as enacted by Mistress Quickly in terms that some scholars have ascribed to Plato's description of the death of Socrates after drinking hemlock.  By comparison, in ""The Merry Wives of Windsor"", Falstaff is presented by Shakespeare as the buffoonish suitor of two married women."
3278,Bardolph (Shakespeare character),"Bardolph is a fictional character who appears in four plays by William Shakespeare.  He is a thief who forms part of the entourage of Sir John Falstaff.  His grossly inflamed nose and constantly flushed, carbuncle-covered face is a repeated subject for Falstaff's and Prince Hal's comic insults and word-play.  Though his role in each play is minor, he often adds comic relief, and helps illustrate the personality change in Henry from Prince to King."

It was founded by the Gloucester Asylum Trust in 1860 as Barnwood House Institution and later became known as Barnwood House Hospital.  The hospital catered for well-to-do patients, with reduced terms for those in financial difficulties.  It was popular with the military and clergy, and once counted an Archbishop amongst its patients.  During the late nineteenth century Barnwood House flourished under superintendent Frederick Needham, making a healthy profit and receiving praise from the Commissioners in Lunacy.  Even the sewerage system was held up as a model of good asylum practice.  After World War I service patients, including war poet and composer Ivor Gurney, were treated with a regime of psychotherapy and recreations such as cricket."
3286,Ivor Gurney,"Ivor Bertie Gurney (28 August 1890 – 26 December 1937) was an English poet and composer, particularly of songs."
3287,World War I in literature,"Literature in World War I is generally thought to include poems, novels and drama; diaries, letters, and memoirs are often included in this category as well.  Although the canon continues to be challenged, the texts most frequently taught in schools and universities are lyrics by Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen; poems by Ivor Gurney, Edward Thomas, Charles Sorley, David Jones and Isaac Rosenberg are also widely anthologised.  Many of the works during and about the war were written by men, because of the war's intense demand on the young men of that generation; however, a number of women (especially in the British tradition) created literature about the war, often observing the effects of the war on soldiers, domestic spaces, and the homefront more generally."
3288,Joseph Campbell (poet),"Joseph Campbell (July 15, 1879 – June 1944) was an Irish poet and lyricist.

3386,Gonzales–Rosewall rivalry,"American tennis player Pancho Gonzales had a long-running rivalry with Australian Ken Rosewall.  Gonzales is still sometimes considered to be a candidate for the greatest tennis player of all time; he was the dominant player of the 1950s and still holds the men's all-time record of being ranked world No. 1 for eight years.  Rosewall became the world's best player upon Gonzales's semi-retirement in 1961 and held that position either by himself or sharing it with others for six years.  Rosewall was signed in 1956 by the promoter Jack Kramer, a former #1 player himself, to join his small band of touring professionals in 1957.  He then engaged in a round-the-world, head-to-head tour against Gonzales, the defending world's champion, over the next five months, winning 26 matches but losing 50.  In his 1979 autobiography Kramer included both Gonzales and Rosewall in his list of the 21 greatest players of all time.  Kramer, however, initially ""panicked"" upon signing Rosewall.He was a cute little fellow with a dink serve, who operated mostly from the baseline.  That great volley of his hadn't been developed yet.  I was afraid that Gorgo would eat him alive and put us out of business the rest of the way.  But like a lot of people I completely underestimated Rosewall.  Before their opening match in Melbourne, Kramer went to Gonzales and asked him to ""carry"" Rosewall, giving him a better share of the gate to gain his assent.  Gonzales did try to carry out his part of the deal for a few matches, but then called it off, telling Kramer that he was no longer able to play his normal game.  Kramer agreed.  ""It was... obvious that Rosewall was not the pushover I had feared.  (In fact, Gonzales only beat him 50–26, and it was always competitive.)""  Six years older than Rosewall, 13 years later, in 1970, Gonzales defeated him in 6–4, 6–4, in the 199th and next-to-last match they ever played—Gonzales was 42 years old at the time and Rosewall was considered to be the co-No.  1 player in the world."

When Setthatirath died near Attapeu under suspicious circumstances in 1572, Sen Soulintha led the armies of Lan Xang back to Vientiane.  A succession dispute erupted, which nearly led to civil war and provided a pretext for another Burmese invasion ordered by Bayinnaung and led by the Chief Minister Binnya Dala.  Sen Soulintha defeated the Burmese and Lan Na forces led by Binnya Dala, an event which led to the latter’s exile, only to face a more massive invasion led by Bayinnaug the following year.  Sen Soulintha again attempted to resort to guerilla tactics, but lacked popular support from his seizure of the throne.  He and his son Ong Lo (Nakhon Noi) were captured by Bayinnaung and exiled to Pegu.  The Burmese placed Setthathirath’s brother, and former ""Ouphahat"" or Viceroy, Prince Tha Heua on the throne.

3470,Impression management,"Impression management is a conscious or subconscious process in which people attempt to influence the perceptions of other people about a person, object or event.  They do so by regulating and controlling information in social interaction.  It was first conceptualized by Erving Goffman in 1959, and then was expanded upon in 1967.  An example of impression management theory in play is in sports such as soccer.  At an important game, a player would want to showcase themselves in the best light possible, because there are college recruiters watching.  This person would have the flashiest pair of cleats and try and perform their best to show off their skills.  Their main goal may be to impress the college recruiters in a way that maximizes their chances of being chosen for a college team rather than winning the game."

3480,Communism in Korea,"The Communist movement in Korea emerged as a political movement in the early 20th century.  Although the movement had a minor role in pre-war politics, the division between the communist North Korea and the anti-communist South Korea came to dominate Korean political life in the post-World War II era.  North Korea, officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, continues to be a Juche ""socialist"" state under the rule of the Workers Party of Korea.  In South Korea, communism remains illegal through the National Security Law.  Due to end of economic aid from Soviet Union after Dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 and impractical ideological application of Communist economy in North Korea over years of economic slowdown in 1980s and receding during 1990s, North Korea replaced Communism with Juche ideology in its 1992 and 1998 Constitutional revision for the personal cult of Kim's family dictatorship and (albeit reluctanly) opening of North Korean market economy reform, though it still remains a centrally planned economy with complete control of the state and agriculture with collectivized farms and state-funded education and healthcare."

3482,United States in the Korean War,"At the conclusion of World War II the Allied nations began the process of disarmament of Axis controlled regions.  Japan occupied Korea at this time and had been in control since 1910.  In 1945, the decision was made to have American Marines forces oversee Japanese surrender and disarmament south of the 38th parallel and the Soviet Union would facilitate the change of power to the north.  At the time there was no political motivation and seemed to be a logical and convenient plan of action.  The original agreement and intent was to create a unified and independent Korea out of the post Japanese occupation era.  Instead each side of the 38th parallel established its own government under the influence of the occupational country; the United States in South Korea and the Soviet Union in North Korea.  Both new Korean governments discredited the other and claimed to be the only legitimate political system.  Tensions between the North and South escalated and each side began to petition foreign powers for resources and support.  South Korea wanted weapons and supplies from Truman and the United States government while North Korea sought help from Stalin and the Soviet Union.  The United States was still war weary from the disruptive World War II campaign and refused South Korea's request for weapons and troops.  North Korea convinced the Soviet Union to supply them with the weapons and support they requested.  This decision coincided with the United States withdrawing the last remaining combat troops from South Korea.  North Korea saw its opportunity and attacked South Korean forces at the 38th parallel on June 25, 1950 and thus initiating the Korean War."

Iran and North Korea pledge cooperation in educational, scientific, and cultural spheres.  Some media reports claim this cooperation extends to nuclear cooperation, though official U.S. government publications and academic studies have disputed this.  The United States has been greatly concerned by North Korea's arms deals with Iran, which started during the 1980s with North Korea acting as a third party in arms deals between the Communist bloc and Iran, as well as selling domestically produced weapons to Iran, and North Korea continues selling missile to Iran.  North Korea and Iran are the remaining two members of George W. Bush's ""Axis of evil"", which has led to many of the concerns regarding Iran–North Korea relations."

Soon after the regiment arrived in that section, he began to develop qualities which attracted the attention first of Col. George Leonard Andrews, his regimental Commander, and finally of General George B. McClellan himself.  The latter then issued orders that ""Jack"" should be allowed to pass through the Federal lines, day or night, whenever he wished.  He used the privilege to good advantage several times saving the Union troops from disastrous surprises.  As a successful scout did he become so annoying and so well-known to the rebels that Confederate Col. Henry Marshall Ashby, offered $500 for his scalp.  Jack, being anxious to see the male who was so anxious to get hold of his top knot, started out toward Petersburg, then held by the rebels, arriving at the house of a Union farmer by which Ashby was expected soon to pass.  He borrowed a suit of clothiers, a horse, and a scythe from the farmer and started up the road to meet said Ashby.

The Confederate government took no action on the appointment and Confederate President Jefferson Davis did not officially appoint and nominate Gordon to the rank of brigadier general because the Confederate Senate last met on March 18, 1865 and Davis was captured by Union troops on May 10, 1865.

3614,Bahá'í Faith in Greater Boston,"The Bahá'í Faith in Greater Boston, a combined statistical area, has had glimpses of the religion in the 19th century arising to its first community of religionists at the turn of the century.  Early newspaper accounts of events were followed by papers on the precursor Bábí religion by Dr. Rev. Austin H. Wright were noted, materials donated, and lost, and then other scholars began to write about the religion.  The community began to coalesce being near to Green Acre, founded by Sarah Farmer, who publicly espoused the religion from 1901.  From then on the institution would progressively be associated with Bahá'ís - a place where both locals and people from afar came to learn of the religion, and who officially took over controlling interest from 1913.  Leaders rising to national prominence with a national level of organization soon arose after `Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, traveled through the area for about 40 days and across the United States for some 239 days.  Most prominent were Harlan Ober, William Henry Randall, and Alfred E. Lunt, who served in events in the Boston area, Green Acre boards, and national institutions of the religion.  In addition to national leaders in the religion, a number of notable individuals joined the religion and were increasingly visible - such as Urbain Ledoux, James Ferdinand Morton, Jr., Nancy Bowditch, and Guy Murchie.  The community moved from beginning to host public meetings to systematically support a presence in a Center in Boston with services and presentations on the religion.  Starting about the 1950s and broadening into the 1960s there was wider recognition of the Bahá'ís themselves.  Sometimes this took the form of noting their persecution in Morocco and then Iran and other times noting local concerts and fairs with their participation.  The modern community, albeit a tiny fraction of the wider population, is present in some concentrations and thin areas throughout the greater Boston area.  Over the last couple of decades it has been systematically pursuing programs of neighborhood community building activities of study circles, children’s classes, junior youth groups, and devotional meetings among the activities and observances of the religion."

A general commonality among past conceptualizations of EO is the inclusion of innovativeness, proactiveness, and risk-taking as core defining aspects or dimensions of the orientation.  EO has been shown to be a strong predictor of firm performance with a meta-analysis of past research indicating a correlation in magnitude roughly equivalent to the prescription of taking sleeping pills and getting better sleep.  Still, some research has argued that EO does not enhance the performance for all firms.  Instead, EO can be argued not to be a simple performance enhancing attribute but rather enhancing if it is applied under the right circumstances of the firm.  In some cases, EO can even be disadvantageous for firms, if the situation of the firm does not fit with applying EO.  Different situations (also known as context) can be the environment that the firm is situated within or internal situations such as structure and strategy."

4339,Special Patrol Group (RUC),"The Special Patrol Group (SPG) of the Royal Ulster Constabulary was a tactical reserve of 150 officers which had the role: ""to provide backup in civil commotion, to police sensitive areas at times of confrontation, and to show the flag in a disciplined and impressive way to those who wished to break the peace.""  Formerly known as the Police Reserve Force, the name was changed to Special Patrol Group in 1970 following the Hunt Report and the reforming of the Royal Ulster Constabularly to bring it more into line with othe U.K. Police Forces i.e .  It became an UNARMED POLICE SERVICE , which was temporarily armed due to the continued murderous campaign waged upon the men and women of the service , whether armed or unarmed and whether on or off duty and also to avoid confusion between the defunct more militarised Reserve Force and the newly formed RUC Reserve which was recommended in the Hunt Report and consisted of a large number of part time , trained officers to help with security and relieve the hard pressed regular officers of some of the more mundane duties as well as a small number of full time Reserve Constables who were more fully integrated into the regular service .  These police reserve officers provided much needed support to the hard pressed regular officers especially in the 1970s when casualties and fatalities among both regular and reserve officers were reaching figures of 2 or 3 officers, on average , being murdered every WEEK .  The Special Patrol Groups were formed as mobile support units originally based around police stations in Belfast and with a section ( Orange Section ) in Armagh and it required a minimum length of service and a rigorous interview process before an officer could be accepted into the ranks . These requirements were later dropped most likely due to the need for greater numbers from what was a small pool as the RUC was greatly undermanned to cope with the terrorist campaigns being waged from various so called Loyalist and Republican organizations .  Officers in the SPG were called upon to deal with major civil unrest as well as numerous , regular bombings , shootings etc sometimes involving multiple bombs in Belfast city centre and other locations on the same day .  In the 1970s the SPG relied heavily on the calibre of its officers as they were poorly equipped , carrying low power Walther pistols and World War 2 , Sterling sub machine guns to defend themselves against terrorists armed with high velocity weapons such as the American Armalite and M1 Carbines as well as RPG Rocket Launchers , various mortar devices and heavy machine guns .  They were so disadvantaged as regarded firepower , that , at one stage in the early 70s , members of the Parachute Regiment were assigned to each long wheel base Land Rover to supplement the meagre firepower of 1 or 2 Sterlings in each crew .  This was a short term exercise as it gave the "" wrong "" image , not at all in keeping with the aims of the aforementioned Hunt Report .  Members of the Royal Military Police were brought in , after the disastrous folly of them trying to patrol staunchly Republican areas such as the Bogside and Creggan in Londonderry , unarmed and in unarmoured cars which were painted white ( to the delight of PIRA Snipers ) which resulted in a number of them being shot .  .  It was not however until an English Chief Constable , Sir Kenneth Newman , took over that the political correctness was set aside and RUC officers in general and the officers of the Special Patrol Groups in particular , were issued with and trained in the use of more uptodate weapons with which to defend themselves and the law abiding citizens of Northern Ireland .  Prior to that the men and women in the SPG in particular had scored many sucesses against the terrorists mainly by their courage and alertness , including intercepting bombs , and preventing numerous gun attacks as well as standing up to hundreds of rioters with little or no protective riot gear ( compared to what we see today )"

4422,Self-confidence,"The concept of self-confidence is commonly used as self-assurance in one's personal judgment, ability, power, etc.  One increases self-confidence from experiences of having mastered particular activities.  It is a positive belief that in the future one can generally accomplish what one wishes to do.  Self-confidence is not the same as self-esteem, which is an evaluation of one’s own worth, whereas self-confidence is more specifically trust in one’s ability to achieve some goal, which one meta-analysis suggested is similar to generalization of self-efficacy.  Abraham Maslow and many others after him have emphasized the need to distinguish between self-confidence as a generalized personality characteristic, and self-confidence with respect to a specific task, ability or challenge (i.e. self-efficacy).  Self-confidence typically refers to general self-confidence.  This is different from self-efficacy, which psychologist Albert Bandura has defined as a “belief in one’s ability to succeed in specific situations or accomplish a task and therefore is the term that more accurately refers to specific self-confidence.  Psychologists have long noted that a person can possess self-confidence that he or she can complete a specific task (self-efficacy) (e.g. cook a good meal or write a good novel) even though they may lack general self-confidence, or conversely be self-confident though they lack the self-efficacy to achieve a particular task (e.g. write a novel).  These two types of self-confidence are, however, correlated with each other, and for this reason can be easily conflated."

With Leah as a matriarch, Biblical scholars regard the tribe as having been believed by the text's authors to have been part of the original Israelite confederation, however, the tribe is absent from the parts of the Bible which textual scholars regard as the oldest (for example, the ancient Song of Deborah), and some scholars think that Simeon was not originally regarded as a distinct tribe."

4519,Mauriac syndrome,"Mauriac syndrome is a rare complication of diabetes mellitus type 1 characterized by extreme hepatomegaly due to glycogen deposition, along with growth failure and delayed puberty.  It occurs in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes as a result of abnormally high blood sugar levels and the symptoms tend to rectify with attainment of normal blood sugar levels.  Abnormally high blood sugar levels are relatively common among patients with type I diabetes, but Mauriac syndrome is rare suggesting that a factor affecting glycogen metabolism in addition to the high level of blood sugar is necessary to cause the syndrome.  A study of an adolescent boy with severe Mauriac syndrome found a mutation in PHKG2 which is the catalytic subunit of glycogen phosphorylase kinase (PhK).  PhK is a large enzyme complex responsible for the activation of glycogen phosphorylase, the first enzyme in the pathway of glycogen metabolism.  Expression of the mutant PHKG2 in a human liver cell line inhibited the enzyme activity of the PhK complex and increased glycogen levels.  The mother of the boy with Mauriac syndrome possessed the mutant PHKG2, but did not have diabetes or a clinically detectable enlarged liver.  The father of the boy had type 1 diabetes with abnormally high blood sugar levels and the size of his liver and his growth were normal.  The study suggests that a mutant enzyme of glycogen metabolism in addition to an abnormally high blood glucose level is necessary to cause Mauriac syndrome."

4523,Cis AB,"Cis AB is a rare mutation in the ABO gene which complicates the basic inheritance pattern and blood-transfusion compatibility matching for ABO blood typing.  There are different DNA mutations of either type A or Type B alleles that change several amino acids in enzyme transferase A or B, homologous enzymes differing in only four of 354 amino acids (R176G, G235S, L266M, and G268A).  A single change in ABO gene DNA could reverse type B to type A and then, a new hybrid enzyme will produce both weak B and A2 (in serum test, A2B and A2B3)).  The most common mutation is an A105 allele variation in exon 7 nucleotide position G803C changing Glycine (type A) to Alanine (type B).  There are another 8 alleles reported in BGMUT, the most discovered reciently in China and Taiwan.  In the cis-AB genotype, both antigens are expressed, like in a standard (trans) AB genotype.  In a traditional AB phenotype, A and B antigenes are inherited separately from the father and mother while a cis-AB allele comes from one parent only.  In a serum test, cis-AB tests almost the same as a traditional AB, but people with this rare type have problems with blood transfusions.  Some of them need components like washed red blood cells or autotransfusion of serum and blood."

Currently, the Premier League does not have a maximum restriction on the number of foreign players allowed on a team, but does require at least eight homegrown players.  Greg Dyke, new chairman of the Football Association (FA), wants to implement much stronger regulation of foreign players.  His intention is clear as stated in an op-ed piece so that England can win the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.  Some of Dyke’s propositions include: homegrown players in a top-flight 25-man first-team squad be increased from eight to 12 two of which must be brought up in the teams youth system, and also changing the definition of what it is to be a homegrown player.  Currently, to be classified as homegrown one must be on an English team for at least three years before the age of twenty-one in which Dyke would like to reduce to eighteen years.  This would mean a teenager would have to be with the club at a maximum age of fifteen and players are not allowed to move across national boundaries, even European Union boundaries, before 16.  Meaning such that, if a foreign player joined an English youth academy at sixteen, in three years time he would be nineteen.  Thus said player failing to qualify as a homegrown player due to the fact he would be older than eighteen.  This has become such a hot topic is because there are currently a group of players who have played 309 international games between them but none of them for England.  While there is currently a list of foreign players, to show the disparity of homegrown players versus foreign players on any given team, the below picture will illustrate such ideas, SkySports hosts an image detailing the number of homegrown players in each Premier League team.  With an apparent low number of English Players on some teams, especially the larger clubs, this ""New York Times"" graph in the article further outlines the disparity between table standings if the only goals scored in season counted were those scored by English players."

4628,Tagalog pocketbooks,"According to Tatin Yang in the article ""Romansang Pinoy: A day with Tagalog romance novels"", Tagalog romance paperbacks were thin Philippine versions of romance novel books that could be found at the bottom shelves of the romance section of bookstores, wrapped and bound with book covers that are decorated with Philippine comics-styled illustrations, such as ""a barrio landscape with a badly dressed guy and girl locked in an embrace"".  As a form of ""escapist fiction"" (escapism) and ""commercial literature"", Tagalog romance novels generally follow a ""strict romance formula"", meaning the narratives have happy endings (a factor influencing the salability of the novel), the protagonists are wealthy, good-looking, smart, and characters that cannot die.  Normally, the hero or heroine of the story falls in love and ""goes crazy"" over the admired person.  However, later authors of Tagalog romance novels deviated from portraying so-called ""damsel-in-distress and knight-in-shining-armor characters"".  Contemporary writers also turned away from writing ""rags-to-riches plots"".  The stereotypical norm had been replaced by the incorporation of storylines with ""interesting scenes, characters [who are ready to face challenges or to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of other people], dialogues, and new angles to old plots"".  Authors such as Maria Teresa Cruz San Diego, who used the pen names Maia Jose and Tisha Nicole, ventured into the fantasy romance genre, and into topics that are related to politics, ecology, gender issues, prostitution, mail-order bride syndicates, white slavery, non-governmental organizations, and breastfeeding programs.

The Lord Admiral would authorize others as his deputies or surrogates to act.  Generally, he would appoint a person as a judge to sit in the Court as his surrogate.  By appointing Vice-Admirals in the colonies, and by constituting courts as Vice-Admiralty Courts, the terminology recognized that the existence and superiority of the “mother” court in the United Kingdom.  Thus, the “vice” tag denoted that whilst it was a separate court, it was not equal to the “mother” court.

The conventional wisdom has the name ‘palouse’ being derived from the French term for the large treeless plain region in eastern Washington stretching into Idaho: the Palouse, a word meaning grassy spot or place.  However, Boone says that the name could originate from the name of a major village of Palouse Indians, Palus, located at the confluence of the Palouse and Snake Rivers.  'Palus' is the Sachapin Indian word for “something sticking down in the water,” in this case the something was a large rock, thought to be a beaver’s heart, and which had an important religious significance for the Palouse Indians.  The Palouse National Forest had its administrative headquarters in the town of Wallace, Idaho for its 15-month existence and was administered by the U.S. Forest Service with 194404 acre .  With the issuance of Executive Order 843 by President Roosevelt on June 26, 1908, with an effective date of July 1, 1908, the entire forest was absorbed by the Coeur d'Alene National Forest and the area ceased to be an independently administered national forest.  The lands of the former Palouse National Forest were then administered as part of the Coeur d’Alene National Forest for three years before being combined with other lands to establish the St. Joe National Forest on July 1, 1911.  The area of the former Palouse National Forest formed the western portion of the St. Joe National Forest.  Once transferred in 1911, the area of the Palouse National Forest became the Palouse Ranger District of the St. Joe National Forest and is still considered part of the St. Joe National Forest.  However, it has been administered by the Clearwater National Forest since the 1973 administrative merger of the Kaniksu National Forest, Coeur d’Alene, and St. Joe National Forests into the Idaho Panhandle National Forests."

It is one of the last green spaces in Beyoğlu and one of the smallest parks of Istanbul.  In May 2013, plans to replace the park with a reconstruction of the former Taksim Military Barracks (demolished in 1940) intended to house a shopping mall sparked the nationwide 2013 protests in Turkey."
4997,Gezi Park protests,"A wave of demonstrations and civil unrest in Turkey began on 28 May 2013, initially to contest the urban development plan for Istanbul's Taksim Gezi Park.  The protests were sparked by outrage at the violent eviction of a sit-in at the park protesting the plan.  Subsequently, supporting protests and strikes took place across Turkey, protesting a wide range of concerns at the core of which were issues of freedom of the press, of expression, assembly, and the government's encroachment on Turkey's secularism.  With no centralised leadership beyond the small assembly that organized the original environmental protest, the protests have been compared to the Occupy movement and the May 1968 events.  Social media played a key part in the protests, not least because much of the Turkish media downplayed the protests, particularly in the early stages.  Three and a half million people (out of Turkey's population of 80 million) are estimated to have taken an active part in almost 5,000 demonstrations across Turkey connected with the original Gezi Park protest.  Eleven people were killed and more than 8,000 were injured, many critically."

5002,Héroïde funèbre (Liszt),"Héroïde funèbre , S. 102, is a symphonic poem written by Franz Liszt in 1850 and published in 1857 as No. 8.  The work originated as the first movement of a planned ""Revolutionary Symphony"" inspired by the July Revolution.  Liszt pays homage in this programmatic symphonic poem to the soldiers and men that died fighting in revolutionary efforts.  The composition of this piece was started in 1830 as a brief sketch for a full symphony, but was dropped by Liszt in the continuing of other works.  However, in 1848, there was an uprising in Liszt's home country of Hungary.  One of Liszt's friends was killed during this revolution, which caused Liszt to revisit his now 20 year old sketch of the Revolutionary Symphony, shortening it and forming the first movement into the commemorative Héroïde funèbre.  Liszt said of the program, ""In these successive wars and carnages, sinister sports, whatever be the colours of the flags which rise proudly and boldly against each other, on both sides they float soaked with heroic blood and inexhaustible tears.  It is for Art to throw her ennobling veil over the tomb of the brave, to encircle with her golden halo the dead and dying, that they may be the envy of the living."""
5003,Piano Sonata No. 12 (Mozart),"The Piano Sonata No. 12 in F major by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, K. 332/300k, was written at the same time as the Piano Sonata, K. 330, and Piano Sonata, K. 331 (""Alla turca""), Mozart numbering them as a set from one to three.  They were once believed to have been written in the late 1770s in Paris, but it is now thought more likely that they date from 1783, by which time Mozart had moved to Vienna.  Some believe that Mozart wrote this and the other sonatas during a summer 1783 visit to Salzburg made for the purpose of introducing his wife, Constanze to his father, Leopold.  All three sonatas were published in Vienna in 1784."
5004,Symphony No. 7 (Shostakovich),"Dmitri Shostakovich's Symphony No. 7 in C major, Op. 60 (titled Leningrad), was written c. 1939–40.  Initially dedicated to the life and deeds of Vladimir Lenin, Shostakovich decided instead to dedicate the symphony to the city of Leningrad on its completion in December 1941.  The work remains one of Shostakovich's best-known compositions."
5005,Piano Sonata No. 3 (Brahms),"The Piano Sonata No. 3 in F minor, Op. 5 of Johannes Brahms was written in 1853 and published the following year.  The sonata is unusually large, consisting of five movements, as opposed to the traditional three or four.  When he wrote this piano sonata, the genre was seen by many to be past its heyday.  Brahms, enamored of Beethoven and the classical style, composed Piano Sonata No. 3 with a masterful combination of free Romantic spirit and strict classical architecture.  As a further testament to Brahms' affinity for Beethoven, the Piano Sonata is infused with the instantly recognizable motive from Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 during the first, third, and fourth movements.  Composed in Düsseldorf, it marks the end of his cycle of three sonatas, and was presented to Robert Schumann in November of that year; it was the last work that Brahms submitted to Schumann for commentary.  Brahms was barely 20 years old at its composition.  The piece is dedicated to Countess Ida von Hohenthal of Leipzig."
5006,Fitzwilliam Sonatas,"Fitzwilliam Sonatas is the name first given by Thurston Dart to an arrangement he made, based on two recorder sonatas by George Frideric Handel, which he recast as a group of three sonatas.  The term was applied by later editors to the original two sonatas as Handel wrote them, and was also expanded to encompass several other sonatas for various instruments included in the Handel autograph manuscripts held by the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge."
5007,Maestoso,"Maestoso (] ) is an Italian musical term and is used to direct performers to play a certain passage of music in a stately, dignified and majestic fashion (sometimes march-like) or, it is used to describe music as such.  Maestoso also is associated with the advent of Classicism, Romanticism, and the newer forms of Neo-Classicism and Neo-Romanticism.  The interpretation of ""Maestoso"" is varied by the conductor depending upon the overall style in which the piece is written.  Used as more of an interpretive choice, this term is not always associated with a specific tempo or tempo range.  The term is commonly used in relatively slow pieces, but there are many examples - such as the first movement of Mozart's Flute Concerto no. 1 - in which a faster tempo can be played in such maestoso.  Common examples of maestoso tempo include Elgar's ""Land of Hope and Glory"", the first movement of Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 21, the first movement of both Anton Bruckner's ""Symphony No. 6"" and Beethoven's ""Symphony No. 9"", as well as Chopin's Polonaise in A flat major, Op. 53.

In 1944 German forces occupied several positions in the SF Rohrbach, forcing advancing American forces to attack them individually or to bypass them.  The German Operation Nordwind offensive of early 1945 caused American forces to fall back, returning to complete the capture of the Rohrbach sector in March 1945.

5197,Desert riparian,"Desert riparian is a North American desert vegetation type (or biome) occurring in the bottoms of canyons and drainages that have water at or near the surface most of the year.  It is contrasted with the desert dry wash vegetation type in which water at or near the surface is lacking most of the year.  The visual character is of large, lush green trees surrounded by dry desert vegetation and soil coloration.  The area may be in a patch surrounding a spring (oasis), or in a strand following the course of water flow.  Over 80% of known desert wildlife species use desert riparian areas.  Common dominant species include Fremont cottonwood (""Populus fremontii""), Arizona ash (""Fraxinus velutina""), arroyo willow (""Salix lasiolepis""), Goodding's willow (""Salix gooddingii""), red willow (""Salix laevigata""), California fan palm (""Washingtonia filifera""), and invasive species such as salt cedar (""Tamarix ramosissima""), giant reed (""Arundo donax""), and Russian olive (""Elaeagnus angustifolia"").  Salt cedar is particularly causing problems for this ecosystem because it is able to extract water more efficiently than cottonwoods and willows.  Many noninvasive non-native species may also be found because springs and surface water areas in the desert often were old homesites where such species were intentionally planted, such as elm, black locust, and assorted fruit trees."
5198,Vegetation and slope stability,"Vegetation and slope stability are interrelated by the ability of the plant life growing on slopes to both promote and hinder the stability of the slope.  The relationship is a complex combination of the type of soil, the rainfall regime, the plant species present, the slope aspect, and the steepness of the slope.  Knowledge of the underlying slope stability as a function of the soil type, its age, horizon development, compaction, and other impacts is a major underlying aspect of understanding how vegetation can alter the stability of the slope.  There are four major ways in which vegetation influences slope stability: wind throwing, the removal of water, mass of vegetation (surcharge), and mechanical reinforcement of roots."

This plant is also used as a medicinal plant and ornamental plant which is attractive to birds."
5200,Wildfire,"A wildfire or wildland fire is a fire in an area of combustible vegetation that occurs in the countryside or rural area.  Depending on the type of vegetation where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire.  Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago.  Wildfire’s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.  Earth is an intrinsically flammable planet owing to its cover of carbon-rich vegetation, seasonally dry climates, atmospheric oxygen, and widespread lightning and volcano ignitions."
5201,Vegetation classification,"Vegetation classification is the process of classifying and mapping the vegetation over an area of the earth's surface.  Vegetation classification is often performed by state based agencies as part of land use, resource and environmental management.  Many different methods of vegetation classification have been used.  In general, there has been a shift from structural classification used by forestry for the mapping of timber resources, to floristic community mapping for biodiversity management.  Whereas older forestry-based schemes considered factors such as height, species and density of the woody canopy, floristic community mapping shifts the emphasis onto ecological factors such as climate, soil type and floristic associations.  Classification mapping is usually now done using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software."

5215,2016–17 video game voice actor strike,"The 2016-17 video game voice actor strike was a strike started on October 21, 2016, by the Screen Actors Guild‐American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) union against 11 American video game developers and publishers (Activision Publishing, Inc.; Blindlight, LLC; Corps of Discovery Films; Disney Character Voices, Inc.; Electronic Arts Productions, Inc.; Formosa Interactive, LLC; Insomniac Games, Inc.; Interactive Associates, Inc.; Take 2 Interactive Software; VoiceWorks Productions, Inc.; and WB Games, Inc) over failed contract renegotiation terms that had been in discussion since February 2015.  Principally, the union sought to have actors and voice and motion capture artists that contribute to video games be better compensated with residuals based on video game sales atop their existing recording payments, while the industry companies asserted that the industry as a whole eschews the use of residuals, and by giving the actors these, they would trivialize the efforts of the programmers and artists that are most responsible for the development of the games.  In exchange, the companies had offered a fixed increase in rates and a sliding-scale upfront bonus for multiple recording sessions, which the union had rejected.  Other issues highlighted by the strike action include better transparency in what roles and conditions actors would perform, more safety precautions and oversight to avoid vocal stress for certain roles, and better safety assurances for actors while on set."

Art games are ""interactive"" (usually ""competitive"" against the computer, self, or other players) and the result of ""artistic intent"" by the party offering the piece for consideration.  They also typically go out of their way to have a unique, unconventional look, often standing out for aesthetic beauty or complexity in design.  The concept has been extended by some art theorists to the realm of modified (""modded"") gaming when modifications have been made to existing non-art games to produce graphic results intended to be viewed as an artistic display, as opposed to modifications intended to change game play scenarios or for storytelling.  Modified games created for artistic purposes are sometimes referred to as ""video game art""."

Video games create new social and cultural worlds – worlds that help people learn by integrating thinking, social interaction, and technology, all in service of doing things they care about.  Computers and other technologies have already changed the way students learn.  Integrating games into education has the potential to create new and more powerful ways to learn in schools, communities and workplaces.  Games and learning researchers study how the social and collaborative aspects of video game play can create new kinds of learning communities.  Researchers also study how the data generated by game play can be used to design the next generation of learning assessments."

In the past, collect calls were only possible as an operator-assisted call, but with the introduction of computer-based telephone dialing equipment, it is now possible to place a collect call without using an operator, which is called automated operator services (AOS) as opposed to Home Country Direct (HCD).  Several companies offer services to place collect calls that compete with local service providers.  Collect calls can be made from almost any public pay telephone in the world by following directions posted on or near the phone.

5247,WSYY-FM,"WSYY-FM (94.9 FM) is a radio station broadcasting for approximately 18¼ hours per day, 7 days a week (from 4:55AM through 11:10PM ET) under the slogan, """"Radio With An Attitude"""".  Playing a mix of oldies/classic hits, adult contemporary, rock music, and some country crossovers, the station broadcasts an Adult Hits/Full-Service format for approximately 16 hours per day, from 6:00AM through 10:00PM ET (reserving the first and, also, the final hour of their broadcast day to ""When Radio Was"").  ""The Mountain 94.9"" carries local high school sports in season.  ""The Mountain 94.9"" had also carried the complete schedule of Red Sox Baseball (from 1997 through 2015, prior to becoming a Former Affiliate in 2016, which was when Millinocket's affiliation with the Red Sox Baseball would ultimately be transferred over to co-owned WSYY-AM, thus concluding the frequent interruptions to the music on ""The Mountain 94.9"" during Baseball season).  The station currently features programming from CBS Radio and carries CBS Radio News at the top of every hour (and has been an affiliate of that network for many decades).  Licensed to Millinocket, Maine, United States, the station's broadcast signal serves the Central Penobscot County, Eastern Piscataquis County, and Southern Aroostook County Maine areas, and the station is licensed to serve the town of Millinocket, Maine, the very town where its studios/offices and tower site are located.  The station is currently owned by Katahdin Communications, Inc.  WSYY-FM originally went on the air in 1978 on 97.7 FM as WKTR, upgrading to its current facilities in 1984 on 94.9.  Prior to their ""The Mountain 94.9"" branding, WSYY-FM used to be referred to as ""North Country 95"", airing a full-time Country Music format.  The current format, branding, and slogan was probably adopted around March 1, 2004, when Katahdin Communications, Inc. assumed control of WSYY-FM & WSYY-AM from Katahdin Timberlands, LLC (as a result of the radio station facing increasing land disputes), initially as a short term lease agreement but the transfer of ownership ultimately became permanent.  Those same land disputes would eventually lead to a loss of WSYY-FM's 23,500 watt transmitter location (featuring an antenna HAAT of 211 meters); as a result, WSYY-FM may have been operating under a Special Temporary Authority License (a 12,000 watt facility with an antenna HAAT of 68 meters via Hammond Ridge on Lake Road, about two miles from Millinocket Municipal Airport), ever since as long ago as late 2007, pending a planned permanent move to a 22,000 watt facility with an antenna HAAT of 198.4 meters (from just off Nicatou Road in Medway, well east of WSYY-FM's old or current transmitter tower location).  On November 23th, 2016, the CP for this proposed move was modified to a 45,000 watt facility with an antenna HAAT of 146.7 meters, the first time this proposed move has ever received official approval from the FCC.  WSYY-FM is one of the two Maine affiliates—apart from WLOB—of When Radio Was (7 days a week from 5:00AM through 6:00AM ET and also from 10:00PM through 11:00PM ET), is one of the two Maine affiliates (WWMJ) of The Acoustic Storm (Saturdays from 9:00AM through 12:00PM ET), is Maine's only affiliate of the Crook & Chase syndicated Country Music countdown programming (Sunday afternoons from 2:00PM through 6:00PM ET), and is an affiliate of the Blues Deluxe radio show.  WSYY-FM/WSYY-AM are unusual in that while these stations are authorized to broadcast 24 hours a day, the stations both have sign-offs every day (WSYY-AM signing off at sun-down, broadcasting only on Weekends (but not between Monday-through-Friday) and WSYY-FM broadcasting for approximately 18¼ hours per day, 7 days a week, WSYY-FM's broadcast day concluding with the 11:00PM ET Top-of-the-Hour CBS Radio newscast and then a Nightly Sign-Off Announcement and then an instrumentation of the American national anthem, followed by Dead Air amidst a Transmitter Power-Down, not Signing Back Onto The Air until 4:55AM ET).  In Old Town and also Bangor (and continuing southward and/or southwestward), the station has strong FM co-channel interference with Portland-market WHOM (which transmits from atop Mount Washington in New Hampshire, the tallest peak in the Northeast and had for a long time claimed on its website that it has the largest coverage area of any FM station in the United States, its signal spanning five states: NH, ME, VT, MA, NY and also parts of Southern Quebec Province, Canada), this matter being especially problematic before dawn or after dusk.  In favorable atmospheric conditions, a very weak signal of WHOM can be DX-ed in Millinocket during overnight hours (when WSYY-FM is off-the-air)."

5318,Rhode Island v. Innis,"Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291 (1980) , is a decision by the United States Supreme Court that clarifies what constitutes ""interrogation"" for the purposes of ""Miranda"" warnings. Under ""Miranda v. Arizona"", police are forbidden from interrogating a suspect once he has asserted his right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment.  In ""Innis,"" the court held that interrogation is not just direct questioning but also its ""functional equivalent""; namely, ""any words or actions on the part of the police ... that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response."""
5319,Miranda v. Arizona,"Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966) , was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court.  In a 5–4 majority, the Court held that both inculpatory and exculpatory statements made in response to interrogation by a defendant in police custody will be admissible at trial only if the prosecution can show that the defendant was informed of the right to consult with an attorney before and during questioning and of the right against self-incrimination before police questioning, and that the defendant not only understood these rights, but voluntarily waived them."
5320,Advocacy and incitement,"Advocacy and incitement are two categories of speech, the latter of which is a more specific type of the former directed to producing imminent lawless action and which is likely to incite or produce such action.  In the 1957 case ""Yates v. United States"", Justice John Marshall Harlan II ruled that only advocacy that constituted an ""effort to instigate action"" was punishable.  In the 1969 case ""Brandenburg v. Ohio"", the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a statute that punishes mere advocacy and forbids, on pain of criminal punishment, assembly with others merely to advocate the described type of action, falls within the condemnation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Justice Louis Brandeis argued in ""Whitney v. California"" that ""even advocacy of violation, however reprehensible morally, is not a justification for denying free speech where the advocacy falls short of incitement and there is nothing to indicate that the advocacy would be immediately acted on."""
5321,Dickerson v. United States,"Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428 (2000) , upheld the requirement that the Miranda warning be read to criminal suspects and struck down a federal statute that purported to overrule ""Miranda v. Arizona"" (1966)."
5322,Bad tendency,"In U.S. law, the bad tendency principle is a test which permits restriction of freedom of speech by government if it is believed that a form of speech has a sole tendency to incite or cause illegal activity.  The principle, formulated in ""Patterson v. Colorado"", (1907) was seemingly overturned with the ""clear and present danger"" principle used in the landmark case ""Schenck v. United States"" (1919), as stated by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. Yet eight months later, at the start of the next Term in ""Abrams v. United States"" (1919) the Court again used the bad tendency test to uphold the conviction of a Russian immigrant who published and distributed leaflets calling for a general strike and otherwise advocated revolutionary, anarchist, and socialist views.  Holmes dissented in ""Abrams"", explaining how the ""clear and present danger test"" should be employed to overturn Abrams' conviction.  The arrival of the ""bad tendency"" test resulted in a string of politically incorrect rulings such as Whitney v. California (1927), where a woman was convicted simply because of her association with the Communist Party.  The court ruled unanimously that although she had not committed any crimes, her relationship with the Communists represented a ""bad tendency"" and thus was unprotected.  The ""bad tendency"" test was finally overturned in Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969) and was replaced by the ""imminent lawless action"" test."
5323,Imminent lawless action,"""Imminent lawless action"" is a standard currently used that was established by the United States Supreme Court in ""Brandenburg v. Ohio"" (1969), for defining the limits of freedom of speech.  ""Brandenburg"" clarified what constituted a ""clear and present danger"", the standard established by ""Schenck v. United States"" (1919), and overruled ""Whitney v. California"" (1927), which had held that speech that merely advocated violence could be made illegal.  Under the imminent lawless action test, speech is not protected by the First Amendment if the speaker intends to incite a violation of the law that is both imminent and likely.  While the precise meaning of ""imminent"" may be ambiguous in some cases, the court provided later clarification in ""Hess v. Indiana"" (1973).  In this case, the court found that Hess's words did not fall outside the limits of protected speech, in part, because his speech ""amounted to nothing more than advocacy of illegal action at some indefinite future time,"" and therefore did not meet the imminence requirement."
5324,Hess v. Indiana,"Hess v. Indiana, 414 U.S. 105 (1973) , was a United States Supreme Court case involving the First Amendment which reaffirmed and clarified the imminent lawless action test first articulated in ""Brandenburg v. Ohio"". "" ""Hess"" continues to be cited by the courts to protect speech that threatens future lawless action."""
5325,Oregon v. Bradshaw,"Oregon v. Bradshaw, 462 U.S. 1039 (1983) , applied the rule first announced in ""Edwards v. Arizona"" (1981) and clarified the manner in which a suspect may waive his right under ""Miranda v. Arizona"" (1966) to have counsel present during interrogation by the police."
5326,Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project,"Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1 (2010) , 130 S.Ct.  2705, was a case decided in June 2010 by the United States Supreme Court regarding the USA PATRIOT Act's prohibition on providing material support to foreign terrorist organizations (18 U.S.C. § 2339B).  The case, petitioned by U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, represents the only time in U.S. First Amendment jurisprudence that a restriction on political speech has passed the ""Brandenburg v. Ohio"" test."
5327,Brandenburg v. Ohio,"Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969) , was a landmark United States Supreme Court case based on the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  The Court held that government cannot punish inflammatory speech unless that speech is ""directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.""  Specifically, it struck down Ohio's criminal syndicalism statute, because that statute broadly prohibited the mere advocacy of violence.  In the process, ""Whitney v. California"" (1927) was explicitly overruled, and doubt was cast on ""Schenck v. United States"" (1919), ""Abrams v. United States"" (1919), ""Gitlow v. New York"" (1925), and ""Dennis v. United States"" (1951)."

Odds are expressed in several ways (see below), and sometimes the term is used incorrectly to mean simply the probability of an event.  Conventionally, gambling odds are expressed in the form ""X to Y"", where X and Y are numbers, and it is implied that the odds are odds against the event on which the gambler is considering wagering.

5370,Saitopolemos,"Saitopolemos is a customary celebration that take place in the Greek city of Messini during Easter.  According to legend, its roots can be traced back to the Greek War of Independence in the 1820s, and especially to a battle the Greeks fought against the army of the Egyptian Sultan Ibrahim Pasha.  However, this explanation is disputed.  The 19th century Greek Romantic tradition used to place the nativity of the majority of Greek customs in the period of Turkish occupation (1453-1821).

5459,Sussex pledge,"The Sussex Pledge was a promise made by Germany to the United States in 1916, during World War 1 before the latter entered the war.  Early in 1915, Germany had instituted a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, allowing armed merchant ships, but not passenger ships, to be torpedoed without warning.  Despite this avowed restriction, a French cross-channel passenger ferry, the ""Sussex"" , was torpedoed without warning on March 24, 1916; the ship was severely damaged and about 49 1/2 people died.  Although no US citizens were killed in this attack, it prompted President Woodrow Wilson to declare that if Germany were to continue this practice, the United States would break diplomatic relations with Germany.

5460,Warship,"A warship is a naval ship that is built and primarily intended for naval warfare.  Usually they belong to the armed forces of a state.  As well as being armed, warships are designed to withstand damage and are usually faster and more maneuverable than merchant ships.  Unlike a merchant ship, which carries cargo, a warship typically carries only weapons, ammunition and supplies for its crew.  Warships usually belong to a navy, though they have also been operated by individuals, cooperatives and corporations."

In 1564, during the Northern Seven Years' War, the ship caught fire and exploded during the first battle of Öland in the Baltic Sea.  ""Mars"" has a place in the history of naval warfare for being the first ship to sink another ship with gunfire."
5462,Raking fire,"In sailing naval warfare, raking fire is fire directed parallel to the long axis of an enemy ship from ahead or astern.  Although each shot is directed against a smaller target profile than by shooting broadside and thus more likely to miss the target ship to one side or the other, an individual cannon shot that hits will pass through more of the ship, thereby increasing damage to the hull, sails, cannon and crew.  In addition, the targeted ship will have fewer (if any) guns able to return fire.  A stern rake tends to be more damaging than a bow rake because the shots are not deflected by the curved (and strengthened) bow, and because disabling the exposed rudder at the stern would render the target unable to steer and thus manoeuvre.  However, achieving a position to rake a single enemy ship was usually very difficult unless the opponent was unable to manoeuvre due to damage to the sails or rudder; it was easier if a ship was constrained by its position in the line of battle."
5463,Her Majesty's Naval Service,"Her Majesty's Naval Service, also known as the Senior Service, is the United Kingdom's naval warfare and maritime service.

5498,Field goal percentage,"Field goal percentage in basketball is the ""ratio"" of field goals ""made"" to field goals ""attempted"".  Its abbreviation is FG%.

In basketball, a FG% of .500 (50%) or above is considered a good percentage, although this criterion does not apply equally to all positions.  Guards usually have lower FG% than forwards and centers. Field goal percentage does not completely tell the skill of a player, but a low field goal percentage can indicate a poor offensive player or a player who takes many difficult shots.  In the NBA, Center Shaquille O'Neal has a high career FG% (around .580) because he plays near the basket making many high percentage layups and slam dunks.

He was the 28th player selected in the 1986 NFL Draft, the first player drafted in the second round of a year in which there were only 27 first-round picks.  His selection was controversial, as he did not score particularly well in the pre-draft combines, and there were more-heralded linebackers still on the board.  Walker attended Carroll High School in Monroe, Louisiana.  He was a latecomer to organized sports, not playing football until high school coaches and his older brother convinced him to join the team in his senior year of high school.  A quick and aggressive player, he was a starter all four years at Jackson State University, where he also played power forward for the basketball team.  In his senior year, he led the team with 131 tackles, was named to two All-American teams, and was named Southwestern Athletic Conference Defensive Player of the Year.  While the Buccaneers staff were impressed with his raw talent and saw him as a potential Ted Hendricks-type player, the fans were critical of the selection of a player with so little training and experience.  Walker started only nine games for the Buccaneers, all in 1987.  Although popular with teammates and a standout on special teams, he never worked his way into the regular lineup.  Buccaneers coach Ray Perkins at one point toyed with the idea of taking advantage of his athleticism by converting him to tight end, but dropped the idea due to lack of interest from Walker.  When Plan B free agency began in 1989, Walker was one of the players allowed to leave.  He was signed by the New York Jets in 1989 after being left unprotected by the Buccaneers, but was cut from the Jets in training camp.  He later played for the Cincinnati Rockers, Miami Hooters, and Orlando Predators of the Arena Football League."

He played in the National Football League for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1993 and 1994.  He had his first start in an NFL game against the San Francisco 49ers in November 1993 and had a 25-yard pass reception in the game.  After spending two seasons with the Buccaneers, Harris was released in August 1995.  He played in 18 games in the NFL, two as a starter.  In his two NFL seasons, he rushed for 29 yards on nine carries and caught six passes for 59 yards."
5538,1994 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season,"The 1994 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season began with the death of owner Hugh Culverhouse.  Ownership was transferred to a three-man board of trustees.  Season ticket sales dwindled, and rumors of the team's location were a persistent distraction all year.  At mid-season, the new ownership removed all personnel responsibilities from coach Sam Wyche, and gave them to Vice President Rich McKay, who they named general manager.  They also put the team up for sale.  On the field, Errict Rhett became the first rookie in the team's history to rush for 1,000 yards, despite not starting until the ninth game of the season.  The Buccaneers had one of the weakest offenses in the league, even while led by a coach who had consistently produced top offenses while with the Cincinnati Bengals.  At 2–9, most people in the Bay area were ready to hang Wyche and pack his bags, but the defensive line improved as Eric Curry finally matured in the second half of the season, and the Bucs began their first 4-game winning streak in 15 years.  It started with an overtime win in Minnesota.  Two wins over the Washington Redskins and one over the Los Angeles Rams set up a big game in Tampa against the Green Bay Packers, who were trying to secure a playoff spot.  ""We've arrived"", Wyche announced prematurely.  The final game was called ""Orange Pride day"", and was attended by 65,000 fans (although many were rooting for the visitors), most of whom expected it to be the last football game in Tampa.  The Packers won, 34–19."
5539,1987 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season,"The 1987 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season was a year of great change for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' organization in the National Football League.

5547,Cochin Moon,"Cochin Moon (コチンの月 , Kochin no Tsuki ) is Haruomi Hosono's fifth solo album.  Initially intended as a collaboration with illustrator Tadanori Yokoo, who traveled to India alongside Hosono (as part of a group) for inspiration; Yokoo ended up only drawing the cover, having been the worst victim of an outburst of severe diarrhea amongst the group during the trip, rendering this as a Hosono solo album.  ""Cochin Moon"" was conceptually written as the soundtrack of a non-existent Bollywood film, a trait inspired by the artists' trip.  The album includes performances by Tin Pan Alley keyboardist Hiroshi Satō and Yellow Magic Orchestra members Ryuichi Sakamoto & Hideki Matsutake.  Despite being Hosono's first completely electronic solo album (at the time YMO's debut was still being recorded, making this Hosono's first electronic album to be released), the exotica feel of Hosono's previous solo work is still present.  The first half of the album (named after an Indian hotel that the group was in for the trip, a picture of the hotel's front appears in the back of the album's packaging) consists of three thematically themed songs, the second half of the album (and Hosono's keyboard performance) is credited to ""Shuka Nishihara"" (西原朱夏 ) , a pseudonym Hosono created as a play on Hakushū Kitahara's pseudonym."

5564,Kedatuan of Dapitan,"The Kedatuan of Dapitan was an ancient Philippine polity once based at Bohol at Tagbilaran Strait.  Bohol's first indigenous people settled in the Anda peninsula.  These people came from northeast Mindanao.  These people were responsible for the Anda petrographs which are one of the most important indigenous rock writing in the country.  Around the 12th century, a group of people from Northern Mindanao settled in the strait between mainland Bohol and the island of Panglao.  Those people came from a nation in northern Mindanao called Lutao (probably the animist kingdom of what will soon be the Islamic Lanao).  Those people established the Kedatuan of Dapitan in western Bohol because the true indigenous people of Bohol in the Anda peninsula and nearby areas were not open to them, forcing them to establish settlement in the western part of the island.  The kedatuan was first built with hardwood on the soft seabed.  It engaged it trade with nearby areas and some Chinese merchants.  The Jesuit Alcina tells tales about a rich nation he called the 'Venice of the Visayas', pointing to the Kedatuan of Dapitan at that time.  The Jesuit also tells of a princess named Bugbung Hamusanum, whose beauty caused her suitor, Datu Sumangga, to raid parts of southern China to win her hand.  By 1563, before the full Spanish colonization agenda came to Bohol, the Kedatuan of Dapitan was at war with the Sultanate of Ternate in the Moluccas (who were also raiding the Rajahnate of Butuan).  At the time, Dapitan was ruled by two brothers named Dalisan and Pagbuaya.  The Ternateans at the time were allied to the Portuguese.  Dapitan was destroyed and Datu Dalisan was killed in battle.  His brother, Datu Pagbuaya, together with his people fled back to Mindanao and established a new Dapitan in the northern coast of the Zamboanga peninsula.  The new Dapitan eventually was incorporated by the Spanish.  Pagbuaya's son, Manooc was among those who sided with the Spanish.  He converted to Christianity and aided the Spaniards in the conquest of Islamic Manila and the Camarines area in Luzon.  The people of Dapitan also assisted the Spanish in the conquest of Northern Mindanao.  Eventually, the Dapitans took their vengeance against the Ternateans when Manooc's cousin, Laria, guided the Spanish in their invasion of the Moluccas (Ternate)."

Written and distributed on June 29, 1995, this letter was written in anticipation of the Fourth World Conference on Women in September 1995, hosted by the United Nations in Beijing.  This letter was an affirmation to the continuing thought of Pope John Paul II on the importance of women in the Church, and the special roles in which only they can contribute in the realms of the family, the Church, and the world.  In his pontificate which lasted longer than 26 years, he continuously upheld the dignity and honor of women, and this letter was a significant contribution to his corpus of works on the importance of women within the Church.

In recent years relations have improved dramatically.  Despite increased trade between the two countries, Argentina and Chile have followed quite different economic policies.

Chile is situated in southern South America, bordering the South Pacific Ocean and a small part of the South Atlantic Ocean.  Chile's territorial shape is among the world's most unusual.  From north to south, Chile extends 4270 km , and yet it only averages 177 km east to west.  On a map, it looks like a long ribbon reaching from the middle of South America's west coast straight down to the southern tip of the continent, where it curves slightly eastward.  Diego Ramírez Islands and Cape Horn, the southernmost points in the Americas, where the Pacific and Atlantic oceans turbulently meet, are Chilean territory.  Chile's northern neighbors are Peru and Bolivia, and its border with Argentina to the east, at 5150 km , is the world's third longest."

The club started out as a 9-hole course, consisting of a club house, a separate pro shop, and a small caddy building.  Before being turned into a golf club, the land was known as the Blackmar Farm, owned by Countess VerHemert of Paris, France.  After her death, the buyers had grandiose plans for the property, and wanted to turn it into a recreation and housing tract.  The original plans were to include a natural amphitheater, similar to the Hollywood Bowl, at the bottom of the knoll on the property, with a golf course running clockwise around it.  Additional plans included a playground for the children and a tennis court.  The golf course materialized first, and the tennis courts were added at a later date.  The architect of the original 9-hole course is unknown, and rumors that famous golf architect Robert Trent Jones Sr. was the architect are incorrect.  However, Robert Trent Jones was the first head golf professional at Sodus Bay Heights from 1930 to 1935, which has led to the confusion on his involvement with the course architecture."

An early competitor in this tournament was a young Henry Cotton later to become Sir Henry.After all the years The Club had played on The Heath, it came as a great shock to receive a notice from The Ascot Authority on the 13 November 2000 to vacate The Heath.  At this time it was a thriving Club with a waiting list for members and a very active social life.  The Committee at the time decided to try to find an alternative location in discussions with The Authority but no progress could be made.The problem was that The Club had no formal lease or agreement.  The Chairman wrote to The Queen and an immediate response was forthcoming.  Land was offered to the Club on the other side of the road in Sunninghill Park and plans to resite The Club started in earnest.

Lotaustralin is the glucoside of methyl ethyl ketone cyanohydrin and is structurally related to linamarin, the acetone cyanohydrin glucoside also found in these plants.  Both lotaustralin and linamarin may be hydrolyzed by the enzyme linamarase to form glucose and a precursor to the toxic compound hydrogen cyanide."
5727,Methylethyl ketone oxime,"Methylethyl ketone oxime is the organic compound with the formula CHC(NOH)CH.  This colourless liquid is the oxime derivative of methyl ethyl ketone.  MEKO, as it is called in the paint industry, is used to suppress ""skinning"" of paints: the formation of a skin on paint before it is used.  MEKO functions by binding the drying agents, metal salts that catalyze the oxidative crosslinking of drying oils.  Once the paint is applied to a surface, MEKO evaporates, thereby allowing the drying process to proceed.  Other antiskinning agents have been used, including phenol-based antioxidants, but these tend to yellow the paint."
5728,Butanone,"Butanone, also known as methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), is an organic compound with the formula CHC(O)CHCH.  This colorless liquid ketone has a sharp, sweet odor reminiscent of butterscotch and acetone.  It is produced industrially on a large scale, and also occurs in trace amounts in nature.  It is soluble in water and is commonly used as an industrial solvent."
5729,3-Hexanone,3-Hexanone (ethyl propyl ketone) is an organic compound with the formula CHO.  It is a ketone used as a solvent and as a chemical intermediate.
5730,2-Hexanone,"2-Hexanone (methyl butyl ketone, MBK) is a ketone used as a general solvent and in paints.  It dissolves cellulose nitrate, vinyl polymers and copolymers, and natural and synthetic resins.  It is recommended as a solvent because it is photochemically inactive; however it has a very low safe threshold limit value.  2-Hexanone is absorbed through the lungs, orally and dermally and its metabolite, 2,5-hexanedione, is neurotoxic.  Animal tests have shown that the neurotoxic effect of 2-hexanone may be potentiated by simultaneous administration of 2-butanone (methyl ethyl ketone, MEK)."
5731,2-Butanol,"2-Butanol, or ""sec""-butanol, is an organic compound with formula CHCH(OH)CHCH.  This secondary alcohol is a flammable, colorless liquid that is soluble in 3 parts water and completely miscible with polar organic solvents such as ethers and other alcohols.  It is produced on a large scale, primarily as a precursor to the industrial solvent methyl ethyl ketone.  2-Butanol is chiral and thus can be obtained as either of two stereoisomers designated as ""(R)""-(−)-2-butanol and ""(S)""-(+)-2-butanol.  It is normally found as an equal mixture of the two stereoisomers — a racemic mixture."
5732,2-Pentanone,"2-Pentanone or methyl propyl ketone (MPK) is a ketone and solvent of minor importance.  It is comparable to methyl ethyl ketone, but has a lower solvency and is more expensive.  It occurs naturally in Nicotiana tabacum (Tobacco) and blue cheese as a metabolic product of Penicillium mold growth."

5734,Methyl ethyl ketone peroxide,"Methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP) is an organic peroxide, a high explosive similar to acetone peroxide.  MEKP is a colorless, oily liquid whereas acetone peroxide is a white powder at STP; MEKP is slightly less sensitive to shock and temperature, and more stable in storage.  Depending on the experimental conditions, several different adducts of methyl ethyl ketone and hydrogen peroxide are known.  The first to be reported was a cyclic dimer, CHO, in 1906.  Later studies found that a linear dimer is the most prevalent in the mixture of products typically obtained, and this is the form that is typically quoted in the commercially available material from chemical supply companies."

It comprises essays written during a difficult time in Twain's life (1904–09), when he was deeply in debt and had recently lost his wife and one of his daughters.  The content concerns morality and religion and strikes a sarcastic — Twain's own term throughout the book — tone.  Initially, another of his daughters, Clara Clemens, objected to its publication in March 1939, probably because of its controversial and iconoclastic views on religion, claiming it presented a """"distorted"""" view of her father.  Henry Nash Smith helped change her position in 1960.  Clara explained her change of heart in 1962 saying that """"Mark Twain belonged to the world"""" and that public opinion had become more tolerant.  She was also influenced to release the papers by her annoyance with Soviet reports that her father's ideas were being suppressed in the United States.

The film treats themes of morality, greed, and the roles of lust, money, and luck in life, leading many to compare it to Allen's earlier film ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" (1989).  It was produced and filmed in London after Allen had difficulty finding financial support for the film in New York.

5757,Stealth helicopter,"Stealth helicopters are helicopters that incorporate stealth technology to avoid detection.  Helicopters are in many ways less suitable for stealth technology than airplanes are, because of the noise generated by their rotor blades, which also give off a strong radar signature.  In recent years, designs for blades have emerged that can significantly reduce noise, which is a major issue for clandestine use of helicopters.  A raid on the compound of Osama bin Laden in May 2011 utilized what appeared to be two Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawks, heavily modified for quieter operations and employing stealth technology to be less visible to radar."

Danish traditional dialects are divided into three main dialect areas: Jutlandic dialect, Insular Danish and Bornholmian.  Bornholmian is the only Eastern Danish dialect spoken in Denmark, since the other Eastern Danish dialects were spoken in areas ceded to Sweden and subsequently assimilated to Standard Swedish.  Jutlandic is further divided into Southern Jutlandic and Northern Jutlandic, with Northern Jutlandic subdivided into North Jutlandic and West Jutlandic.  Insular Danish is divided into Zealand, Funen, Møn and Lolland-Falster dialect areas - each with addition internal variation."

Rather these dialects have been maintained or are facing critical endangerment within respective Judeo-Iraqi diasporas, namely those of Israel and the United States.  In 2014, the film ""Farewell Baghdad"" (Arabic: مطير الحمام; Hebrew: מפריח היונים, lit.

The dialect is part of the Northwestern Bulgarian dialects.  The most significant feature of the dialect, as in all Western Bulgarian dialects, is the pronunciation of Old Church Slavonic ѣ (yat) only as ɛ instead of formal and Eastern Bulgarian я/е (ʲa ~ɛ ) – ""бел/бели"" instead of бял/бели.  Otherwise, the Byala Slatina-Pleven dialect bears strong resemblance to its neighbouring Eastern Bulgarian dialects and with some exceptions, mainly the pronunciation of yat, has the same phonological and morphological features as the neighbouring subdialects of the Eastern Bulgarian Central Balkan dialect."

The range of the Southwestern dialects on the territory of Bulgaria includes most of west central and southwestern Bulgaria.  The Southwestern dialects border on the Northwestern dialects to the north, the Transitional dialects to the northwest and the Balkan dialects and the Rup dialects to the northeast and southeast, respectively.  If the Macedonian language is regarded as a third literary form of Modern Bulgarian, then the Southwestern dialects extend west and southwest to include the Slavic dialects in Vardar Macedonia and the western half of Greek Macedonia.  Should the Macedonian language be counted as a separate language, then the southernmost dialect of the group, the Blagoevgrad-Petrich or Pirin dialect, along with the corresponding variety on the Macedonian side of the border, the Maleshevo dialect, constitute a transitional dialect between Bulgarian and Macedonian.  A defining characteristic of the Southwestern dialects is the gradual transition from one dialect to another, as well as to dialects which belong to other dialectal groups.  For example, the Dupnitsa dialect is transitional to both the Samokov dialect and the Blagoevgrad-Petrich dialect, the Botevgrad dialect is transitional to the Eastern Bulgarian Balkan dialects, and especially to the Pirdop dialect, etc. etc."

5861,General Motors 90° V6 engine,"The Chevrolet 90° V6 family of engines began in 1978 with the Chevrolet 200 cid (3.3 L) V6 as the base engine for the all new 1978 Chevrolet Malibu.  The original engine family was phased out in early 2014, with its final use as the 4.3 L V6 engine used in Chevrolet and GMC trucks and vans.  Its phaseout marks the end of an era of Chevrolet small-block engine designs dating back to the 1955 model year.  A new Generation V 4.3 L V6 variant entered production in late 2013, based on the LT1 small block V8 used in the 2014 Chevrolet Silverado."

5864,Modal voice,"Modal voice is the vocal register used most frequently in speech and singing in most languages.  It is also the term used in linguistics for the most common phonation of vowels.  The term ""modal"" refers to the resonant mode of vocal cords; that is, the optimal combination of airflow and glottal tension that yields maximum vibration."
5865,Pre-Celtic,"The term pre-Celtic refers to the period in the prehistory of Central and Western Europe postdating the emergence of the Proto-Celtic language and cultures and predating the expansion of the Celts or their culture in Iron Age Europe and Anatolia (9th to 6th centuries BC).  The area involved is that of the maximum extent of the Celtic languages in about the mid 1st century BC.  The extent to which Celtic language, culture and genetics coincided and interacted during this period remains very uncertain and controversial."
5866,Multiple kernel learning,"Multiple kernel learning refers to a set of machine learning methods that use a predefined set of kernels and learn an optimal linear or non-linear combination of kernels as part of the algorithm.  Reasons to use multiple kernel learning include a) the ability to select for an optimal kernel and parameters from a larger set of kernels, reducing bias due to kernel selection while allowing for more automated machine learning methods, and b) combining data from different sources (e.g. sound and images from a video) that have different notions of similarity and thus require different kernels.  Instead of creating a new kernel, multiple kernel algorithms can be used to combine kernels already established for each individual data source."
5867,Maximum life span,"Maximum life span (or, for humans, maximum reported age at death) is a measure of the maximum amount of time one or more members of a population have been observed to survive between birth and death.  The term can also denote an estimate of the maximum amount of time that a member of a given species could survive between birth and death, provided circumstances that are optimal to that member's longevity."
5868,Turnpike theory,"Turnpike theory refers to a set of economic theories about the optimal path of accumulation (often capital accumulation) in a system, depending on the initial and final levels.  In the context of a macroeconomic exogenous growth model, for example, it says that if an infinite optimal path is calculated, and an economic planner wishes to move an economy from one level of capital to another, as long as the planner has sufficient time, the most efficient path is to quickly move the level of capital stock to a level close to the infinite optimal path, and to allow capital to develop along that path until it is nearly the end of the desired term and the planner must move the capital stock to the desired final level.  The name of the theory refers to the idea that a turnpike is the fastest route between two points which are far apart, even if it is not the most direct route."
5869,Luffing,"In sailing, luffing refers to when a sailing vessel is steered far enough toward the direction of the wind (""windward""), or the sheet controlling a sail is eased so far past optimal trim, that airflow over the surfaces of the sail is disrupted and the sail begins to ""flap"" or ""luff"" (the luff of the sail is usually where this first becomes evident).  This is not always done in error; for example, the sails will luff when the bow of the boat passes through the direction of the wind as the sailboat is tacked."
5870,Preglottalized stop,"Preglottalized stop is a poorly defined concept in phonetics.  Depending on the author, the term may mean implosive; implosive with little ingressive airflow; voiceless implosives; or consonantal segments that have a glottal component preceding an oral component, something that is not known to ever be phonologically relevant."
5871,Optimal discriminant analysis,"Optimal Discriminant Analysis (ODA) and the related classification tree analysis (CTA) are exact statistical methods that maximize predictive accuracy.  For any specific sample and exploratory or confirmatory hypothesis, optimal discriminant analysis (ODA) identifies the statistical model that yields maximum predictive accuracy, assesses the exact Type I error rate, and evaluates potential cross-generalizability.  Optimal discriminant analysis may be applied to > 0 dimensions, with the one-dimensional case being referred to as UniODA and the multidimensional case being referred to as MultiODA.  Classification tree analysis is a generalization of optimal discriminant analysis to non-orthogonal trees.  Classification tree analysis has more recently been called ""hierarchical optimal discriminant analysis"".  Optimal discriminant analysis and classification tree analysis may be used to find the combination of variables and cut points that best separate classes of objects or events.  These variables and cut points may then be used to reduce dimensions and to then build a statistical model that optimally describes the data."
5872,Falsettone,"Falsettone is a term used in modern Italian musicology to describe a vocal technique used by male opera singers in the past, in which the fluty sounds typical of falsetto singing are amplified by using the same singing technique used in the modal voice register.  The result is a bright, powerful tone, often very high-pitched, although the sound is still different from and more feminine than what is produced by the modal voice.  The term ""falsettone"" is also used for the mixed vocal register that can be achieved using this technique."
5873,Saltillo (linguistics),"In Mexican linguistics, saltillo (Spanish, meaning ""little skip"") refers to a glottal stop consonant, ʔ] .  It was given that name by the early grammarians of Classical Nahuatl.  In a number of other Nahuan languages, the sound cognate to Classical Nahuatl's glottal stop is h] , and the term ""saltillo"" is applied to either pronunciation.  The saltillo is often spelled with an apostrophe, though it is sometimes spelled (with either pronunciation) ⟨h⟩ , or, when pronounced [h] , ⟨j⟩ .  The spelling of the glottal stop with an apostrophe-like character most likely originates from transliterations of the Arabic hamza.  It has also been spelled with a grave accent over the preceding vowel in some Nahuatl works, following Horacio Carochi (1645)."
