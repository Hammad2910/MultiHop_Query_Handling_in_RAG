    "\n",
    "Definitions:\n",
    "- A question is **SINGLEHOP** if it can be answered using a single fact, sentence, or document. The question may be long, but if it doesn't require combining or reasoning over multiple distinct pieces of information, it's SINGLEHOP.\n",
    "- A question is **MULTIHOP** if answering it requires combining multiple facts, reasoning over several steps, or connecting pieces of information from different sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è Important:\n",
    "- A question's length does not determine its type. A long, descriptive question can still be SINGLEHOP.\n",
    "- MULTIHOP questions typically require you to first find one piece of information, then use that to find the next.\n",
