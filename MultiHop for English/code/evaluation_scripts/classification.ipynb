    "\n",
    "Definitions:\n",
    "- A question is **SINGLEHOP** if it can be answered using a single fact, sentence, or direct piece of information. Even if the question seems long, if it refers to only one piece of knowledge, it's SINGLEHOP.\n",
    "- A question is **MULTIHOP** if it requires combining two or more distinct facts, reasoning through multiple steps, or connecting information from different sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "🚨 Key Indicators:\n",
    "- MULTIHOP questions often have two parts or require using the answer to one part to answer the next.\n",
    "- Look for compound instructions, temporal reasoning, or layered dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SINGLEHOP: \"What is the capital of Japan?\" → Can be answered with one direct fact.\n",
    "2. MULTIHOP: \"What is the capital of the country that hosted the 2016 Olympics?\" → First identify the country, then find its capital.\n",
